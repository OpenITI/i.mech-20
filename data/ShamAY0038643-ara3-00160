Yet, they have also been advised to spend the spare money on the needy. Man has been told that it is unwise on his part to be niggardly about money because it spawns unfavourable results in this world as well as in the Hereafter.

Jabir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent us in an expedition under the command of Abu `Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) to intercept a caravan of the Quraish. He provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he found nothing for us. Abu `Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) gave each of us one date (every day). He (the narrator) was asked: "What did you do with that?'' He said: We sucked that just like a baby and then drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until night. We beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then went to the seaside, when there appeared before us something like a big mound. We came near it and we found that it was a beast called Al-Anbar. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "It is dead (so it useless for us).'' He then said: "No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in the way of Allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.'' We, three hundred in number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to eat of that fish). He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large pieces of meat for use in our journey. When we came back to Al-Madinah we went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and told him about that, whereupon he said, "That was a sustenance Allah had brought forth for you.

They braved it patiently. Secondly, The blessing came to them in the sense that each one of them was patient enough to live on a single date-fruit and water in twenty-four hours. Thirdly, it emphasizes that according to the circumstances, there is always room for Ijtihad (independent juristic reasoning). First Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) hesitated, but later he established a different opinion on the basis of his Ijtihad and decided to use the body of the giant fish as food. Fourthly, it provides us a proof of the sacrifice of the Companions that Allah miraculously granted them such a huge sea-fish that a group of three hundred people kept eating for one month. Fifthly, it tells us that a sea-carrion is a lawful food as indicated in another Hadith: "The water of the sea and its carrion are both Halal.''

The Companions went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and told him about it. He said, "I will go down the trench to see it.'' He stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone over his stomach due to intense hunger. We had not tasted anything for three days. He took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it turned into sand. I sought his permission to go home, (after reaching home I) said to my wife, "I have seen the Prophet (PBUH) in a state that I am unable to endure. Have you got anything in the house?'' She said, "I have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.'' I slaughtered the lamb, ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. Then I went to the Prophet (PBUH). In the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the meat in the pot was nearly cooked. I said to him, "O Messenger of Allah, I have some food, will you come along with one or two Companions?'' He asked, "How many men should go there?'' I told him the number. He said, "It will be better if they are more in number. Tell your wife not to remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till I arrive.'' Then he said to the Muhajirun and the Ansar: "Let us go (to eat).''

I replied in the affirmative. (When they arrived) Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to his Companions, "Enter, but do not crowd in.'' Then he started breaking up the bread and putting meat on it. He would take from the pot and the oven then would cover them up, approach his Companions and hand it over to them. He would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. He continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to their fill and still some of the food remained. Then he said to my wife, "Eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been afflicted with severe hunger.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Another narration is: Jabir said: When the trench was being dug, I noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (PBUH).

She brought out a bag which contained a Sa` (a measure that equals approximately 3kg.) of barley. We had a lamb which was reared in the home. I slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour for baking bread. I then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot. When I was returning to Messenger of Allah (PBUH), my wife said to me, "Do not embarass me before Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and his Companions.'' (She said this because she thought that the food would not be enough for everyone, for how can very little food cater for a thousand people?) When I came to him, I said to him in a low tone, "O Messenger of Allah (PBUH), we have slaughtered a small lamb and have ground a Sa` of barley. Please accompany me with a few of your Companions.'' Thereupon he (PBUH) announced in a loud voice, "O people of the Trench, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so all of you are welcome.'' And addressing me he said, "Do not take the pot off the fire, nor bake the kneaded flour till I arrive.'' So I came home and he came ahead of the people. My wife said, "It will be a matter of disgrace for you (because there is not enough food).'' I said, "I did only what you told me.'' She brought out the kneaded flour and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) spat into it, and invoked the blessing of Allah on it, and then he spat into the cooking pot and invoked the blessing of Allah on it. Then he said, "Call another woman to help bake bread and let her take out from the cooking pot, but do not take it off the fire.'' There were about a thousand guests. All of them ate till they left the food and went off. Our pot still bubbled as before and the dough was being baked as before.(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith throws light on the simple life style which the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions led. It also throws light on the miracle of the augmentation of food. Besides, it highlights the humbleness of the Prophet (PBUH) that he, side by side with his Companions, also did hard and arduous jobs.

Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) said to (to his wife) Umm Sulaim(May Allah be pleased with her), "I noticed some weakness in the voice of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and I feel it was due to hunger. Have you got any food?'' She said, "Yes.'' So she brought out barley loaves, took off her head covering, in a part of which she wrapped these loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I set forth and found Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sitting in the mosque in the company of some people. I stood near them whereupon Messenger of Allah (PBUH) asked, "Has Abu Talhah sent you?'' I said, "Yes.'' Thereupon he said to those who were with him to get up (and follow him). He went forth and so did I, ahead of them until I came to Abu Talhah and informed him. Abu Talhah said, "O Umm Sulaim, here comes Messenger of Allah (PBUH) along with the people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them.'' She said, "Allah and His Messenger know better.'' Abu Talhah went out (to receive him) until he met Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and he came forward along with him until they both (Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) came in. Then Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "O Umm Sulaim, bring forth what you have with you.'' So she brought the bread. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces and after Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) had squeezed clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) recited over it what Allah wished him to recite. He then said, "Allow ten guests to come in.'' They ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (Messenger of Allah (PBUH)) again said, "Allow ten (more to come in)'', and he (the host) ushered them in. They ate to their fill. Then they went out. He (PBUH) again said, "Allow ten (more),'' until all the people ate to their fill. They were seventy or eighty persons.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Another narration is: Anas said: When all had eaten, the remaining food was collected. It was as much as there was in the beginning.(@)(@@) Yet another narration is: Anas said: The groups of ten people ate by turn. After eighty persons had eaten, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and the family of that house ate, and there was still a quantity left over.(@)(@@) Another narration is: Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I visited Messenger of Allah (PBUH) one day, and found him sitting in the company of his Companions, with a belt tied over his waist. I asked, "Why has Messenger of Allah (PBUH) tied the belt on his waist?'' I was told, "Due to hunger.'' I went to Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) the husband of Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) and said, "O father, I have seen Messenger of Allah (PBUH) with a belt tied over his waist. I asked one of his Companions about the reason of it and he said that it was on account of severe hunger.'' Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) went to my mother and asked, "Have you got anything?'' She said, "Yes. I have a piece of bread and some dry dates. Were Messenger of Allah (PBUH) to come alone, we could feed him his fill, but if he comes along with others, there would not be enough food.'' Anas then narrated the Hadith in full.(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith mentions the same things we have seen in the previous one. Yet, in this latter one, there is an elucidation that the Prophet (PBUH) and the host-family took meal after everybody had taken it. Imam An-Nawawi said: This shows that it is desirable that hosts should take meal after guests have taken it.(@)(@@) Secondly, Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) addressed Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) as father and he did so out of respect. Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was the step-father of Anas (May Allah be pleased with him). His real father was Malik bin An-Nadir and mother was Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with him). She embraced Islam but her husband remained a non-believer. He left his Muslim wife and migrated to Syria where he died. Afterwards she married Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him). Thirdly, the events of ascetic, contented and destitute life as experienced by the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions are unthinkable today. But these are such facts, reported most authentically, as can be hardly refuted by being labelled as myths. Yet, some scholars say that it was a particular phase of time when there existed a conflict between Islam and paganism. It demanded that Muslims, by being indifferent to the world and its comforts, should be engaged day and night in uprooting disbelief, and paving the way for the predominance of Islam.(@)PageV01P633(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 57 - باب السابع والخمسون في القناعة والعفاف والاقتصاد في المعيشة والإنفاق وذم السؤال من غير ضرورة(@)(@@) Chapter 57(@)(@@) Contentment and Self-esteem and avoidance of unnecessary begging of People PageV01P634 قال الله تعالى ( هود 6 ) : { وما من دابة في الأرض إلا على الله رزقها }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( البقرة 273 ) : { للفقراء الذين أحصروا في سبيل الله لا يستطيعون ضربا في الأرض يحسبهم الجاهل أغنياء من التعفف تعرفهم بسيماهم لا يسألون الناس إلحافا }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الفرقان 67 ) : { والذين إذا أنفقوا لم يسرفوا ولم يقتروا وكان بين ذلك قواما }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الذاريات 56 ، 57 ) : { وما خلقت الإنس والجن إلا ليعبدون ما أريد منهم من رزق وما أريد أن يطعمون }(@)(@@) وأما الأحاديث فتقدم معظمها في البابين السابقين . ومما لم يتقدم :(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah.''

On this the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) praised Allah and glorified Him and said, "It is a fact that I give to one and overlook another. The one I ignore is dearer to me than the one I give. I give to those in whose hearts I perceive anxiety; others I leave with the richness and contentment that Allah has put in their hearts. One of them is `Amr bin Taghlib.''

In distribution, he weighed different considerations in his mind and the beneficiaries were categorized into three groups: the needy, the deserving cases and those whose hearts were to be won over. His primary concern, however, was to make donations to only those people about whom he had apprehensions that, if ignored, they would display impatience and weakness. In this way the reliable and contented type of men were intentionally ignored. The superiority of `Amr bin Taghlib (May Allah be pleased with him) is determined by the fact that the Prophet (PBUH) counted him among the latter, and he rightly took it as a great honour for him. Hence, we conclude that a ruler enjoys powers of expediency with regard to doling out from the public treasury.

Also the Prophetic argument tells us that any manual skill or occupation, and the one who depends on it for his living should not be considered inferior. Instead, such people deserve respectable and worthy place in society because they emulate the example of the Prophets. In our society, a highbrow attitude towards them is unfortunate and deserves our deprecation.

The result of this sensible policy was that if somebody had embraced Islam for the sake of gaining material gains, this sentiment, in due course of time, would be stripped off from his heart, and finally he would turn into a sincere Muslim. In view of its rationale, Allah has termed the policy of reconciling hearts, to Islam as a Zakat expenditure. In other words, an allocated sum of the Zakat fund can be expended on this head as well. Some scholars argue that it is now no more permissible to spend on this head. But to be accurate, expending out of the Zakat fund on this head is valid for all times.

Whereas a miser faces a warning that his sins and defects will be made known to people and not concealed from them, and he will remain the target of miseries. We are further told that when a generous man intends to give charity, his chest expands for it and he happily gives vent to his generosity. On the other hand, when a niggardly man intends to spend money in charity, his chest contracts and he withholds his giving hand.

This commandment, however, is not of essential and binding nature. If it were so, no Muslim could be in a position to amass wealth. This is simply desirable and based on free will. If the common Muslims were possessed of generosity, this moral instruction would have been practised by all and sundry with Muslim society being exemplary in terms of brotherhood and solidarity. Yet, the lack of sublime morals has denuded this precept of its entire import and significance. Small wonder, in Muslim communities there is a general deplorable trend of showing indifference to fellow-Muslims, instead of establishing a worth- emulating example of co-operation and fellow-feeling.(@)(@@) .(@)PageV01P690(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 567 - وعن سهل بن سعد رضي الله عنه أن امرأة جاءت إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ببردة منسوجة فقالت : نسجتها بيدي لأكسوكها . فأخذها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم محتاجا إليها فخرج إلينا وإنها لإزاره . فقال فلان : اكسنيها ما أحسنها فقال : [ نعم ] فجلس النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم في المجلس ثم رجع فطواها ثم أرسل بها إليه . فقال له القوم : ما أحسنت لبسها النبي صلى الله

Sahl (the narrator of this Hadith) said: And in fact it was used as his shroud.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: First, the Hadith is suggestive of accepting a present because the exchange of presents increases mutual love. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Offer presents to each other as these generate mutual love.'' Second, the Prophet (PBUH) would never turn down anyone asking for something. Third, it is permissible to get a thing prepared to meet a future need. Fourth, we are allowed to receive a benediction from the pious ones as the Companions did in case of those things which had touched the blessed body of Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Yet, today the benedictory sanction is being misapplied by people. For example, the washing of graves is erroneously taken to be a sacred act. Whereas, going by the Islamic Law, there is no room for the concretion of a grave, still less of washing it. Rather this act is unclean and sacrilegious. Similarly, we see some half-mad and insane people bereft of the sense of purity and cleanliness. Yet, the masses consider them to be ecstatics and even try to seek benediction from them. As a matter of fact, such lunatics are totally unconscious of the obligations of Islam, rather everything else. But the sanity of a man becomes questionable if he considers them saints.

In the said incident, Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) then a young boy, was sitting on the right side, while the aged people were sitting on the left side. Regard for the age difference demanded that the beginning should have been made from the side of the latter. But the correct way was that the beginning should be made from Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) because he was sitting on the right side. For this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) did not ignore his right of priority due to his young age, rather by seeking his permission he made it clear that priority should be given to a rightful person, irrespective of the fact that he happened to be a child. On the other hand, it was also essential for Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) that in view of respect for elders, he should surrender his right. But he faced a more delicate problem. The cup containing the left-over drink of the Prophet (PBUH) had touched his blessed mouth and this fact prompted Ibn `Abbas i(May Allah be pleased with them) to take lead in benefiting from the benediction. He, therefore, preferred the Prophetic benediction to showing respect to the aged.

Yet, its relevance with this chapter has prompted us to repeat it here. It lays emphasis on two points. First, if Allah gives wealth to a man, his sense of gratitude should be expressed in his spending it in good ways according to the Divine command. Second, if Allah has endowed somebody with knowledge and wisdom, he should be thankful to his Rubb by way of putting it into practice and by imparting it to others. It means one can aspire for knowledge and richness, provided one's motive is to benefit others. Envy is a bad quality which Muslims must shun. In this Hadith, however, envy (or Ghibtah) refers to the feeling of wishing to have what somebody else has or to be like somebody else without these blessings be taken away from the envied person.(@)PageV01P699(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 572 - وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ لا حسد إلا في اثنتين : رجل آتاه الله القرآن فهو يقوم به آناء الليل وآناء النهار ورجل آتاه الله مالا فهو ينفقه آناء الليل وآناء النهار ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) [ الآناء ] : الساعات(@)(@@) 572.

To apply and teach knowledge means to put into practise the teachings of the Qur'an. And that includes the recitation of the Qur'an (both in Salat and otherwise), imparting its teaching and passing judgements in its light. From this point of view both the Ahadith convey the similar sense, and similarly we may also read into them two persons or two traits of character.(@)PageV01P700(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 573 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن فقراء المهاجرين أتوا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقالوا : ذهب أهل الدثور بالدرجات العلى والنعيم المقيم . فقال : [ وما ذاك ؟ ] فقالوا : يصلون كما نصلي ويصومون كما نصوم ويتصدقون ولا نتصدق ويعتقون ولا نعتق . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ أفلا أعلمكم شيئا تدركون به من سبقكم وتسبقون به من بعدكم ولا يكون أحد أفضل منكم إلا من صنع مثل ما صنعتم ؟ ] قالوا : بلى يا رسول الله . قال : [ تسبحون وتحمدون وتكبرون دبر كل صلاة ثلاثا وثلاثين مرة ] فرجع فقراء المهاجرين إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقالوا : سمع إخواننا أهل الأموال بما فعلنا ففعلوا مثله . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ ذلك فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء ] متفق عليه . وهذا لفظ مسلم(@)(@@) [ الدثور ] : الأموال الكثيرة والله أعلم(@)(@@) 573.

Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "This is Grace of Allah which He gives to whom He wishes.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: The wording of the Hadith apparently reveals that Subhan Allah "Glory be to Allah'', Al-hamdu lillah "Praise be to Allah'', and Aallhu Akbar "Allah is the Greatest'' should be recited thirty-three times. If each group of words is said eleven times, the total number will become thirty-three. But Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar believes that each formula should be uttered thirty-three times, that is to say, after each prayer "Subhan Allah'', "Al-hamdu lillah'' and "Allahu Akbar'' should be uttered thirty-three times each. But according to some Ahadith, Imam An- Nawawi is of the view that "Allahu Akbar'' should be said thirty-four times and in the end "La ilaha illallahu Wahdahu la sharika Lahu, Lahul- mulku wa Lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai'in Qadir'' (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, He is One; He has no partners; to Him belongs the dominion and all the praise; and He has power over all things) should be recited. Should we recite them together or separately? Al-Qadi `Iyad is of the opinion that it is better to recite them separately, but Imam An-Nawawi is of the view that both ways are correct. In fact, in both ways the number remains the same. Besides, an addition must not be made to the Sunnah of Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Practically we knew that it is necessary to use the prescription of a physician without making any alteration in its elements; otherwise, it will not work properly. Similarly, there are spiritual benefits, blessings and efficacy in the number told by the Prophet (PBUH). Any alteration in it will nullify its blessing and efficacy.

Indeed, all Muslims are equal with regard to the practice of religious principles.
