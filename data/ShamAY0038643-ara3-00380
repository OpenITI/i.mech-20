We learn from these Ahadith that it is permissible to keep dogs for hunting and security of herds and farms but not for any other purpose. If anyone does so, he will be losing a Qirat or two from his rewards everyday. Why did the Prophet (PBUH) use the words Qirat or two Qirat? Some scholars say that at first the Prophet (PBUH) said one and subsequently increased the number. Some scholars hold that the difference of one and two relates to urban and rural areas. The inhabitants of cities would be losing two Qirat from their rewards daily, while in case of villagers this loss will be one Qirat only, because they stand in greater need of dogs.(@)(@@) 2. Why does the reduction in reward take place? In response to this question, it has been stated that it is very difficult to escape from the filth of dogs and sometimes it adversely effects even Salat and reduces their reward. Some scholars say that since dogs are apt to bark on guests and beggars and scare them, the tension caused by this affects the reward of the host. Allah Alone knows the truth of the matter.(@)(@@) What is Qirat? It is differently interpreted. There is a Qirat which is mentioned in the funeral prayer. This is equal to the Uhud mountain.

Far less than this sin would be the breaking of the oath to normalize his relation with his wife and children. The essence of all these Ahadith is that if one comes to realize that, after taking an oath, his oath was wrong, then he must break the oath and do what he had vowed not to do. There are different forms of breaking the oaths. For instance, if one has taken an oath that he will drink alcohol, it will be obligatory for him to break his oath. Or if one takes an oath to not to do a thing which is desirable, or taken an oath to do something which is not desirable, then it will be desirable to break the oath. Similarly, if one takes an oath to not to do something permissible then the act of breaking the oath will also come in the category of permissible.(@)(@@) 2. The expiation of an oath is necessary.

The expiation prescribed by him was 15 Sa` dates which were to be divided among sixty poor fellows. Since one Sa` consists of four Mudd, the quantity of food, without curry, for ten persons would be six kilograms. (Ibn Kathir). This means that it would be six kilograms of flour, or rice, or dates etc. Thus, even if ten poor persons are served with an average meal, it would be a substantial quantity.

If a reference is made to the cause or causes which occasion an incident or event, it is permissible but to ascribe them entirely to some factor or factors is the conduct of polytheists and amounts to Shirk and Kufr. 2.

It should also be borne in mind that when holding a conversation which is disliked or forbidden at other times becomes even more so at this particular time (i.e., after `Isha' prayer). Imam An-Nawawi's contention that things like academic discussion, talking to a guest, discussing the lives of the pious etc., are not only permissible but desirable, is also subject to the condition that such an activity does not involve the risk of losing the Fajr prayer.

Some scholars are of the opinion that one can continue the performance of Fajr Sunnah, even after the congregational Salat has started. They have taken the plea that if there is no risk of losing the first Rak`ah, it is permissible to continue the Sunnah of Fajr prayer. Their plea is against the present Hadith. It is a common feature to see the worshippers offering Sunnah during the course of Fajr prayer offered in congregation.

"He should not make a deal'' here signifies that the urbanite should not go to the villager and propose to him leave his goods with him for sale and he would send him the sale proceeds of the goods piecemeal as they sell. In the opinion of some `Ulama' this is prohibited if the merchandise is valuable and the villager is not aware of its real worth and the urbanite wants to exploit his ignorance. But, on the contrary, if the proposal is for the welfare of the villager and the urbanite merely wants the owner to receive its due price then the offer is admissible. The first proposition is prohibited because that will cause a loss to the villager; the second is permissible as it is a well-meaning offer.(@)(@@) "A person in the city should not make a deal on behalf of a villager'' has been interpreted by `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) to mean that he should not work as a broker for a villager because in that case he will be interested to sell it on a higher price in order to have a better commission in the deal, which will unnecessarily raise its cost.(@)(@@) On one side, the purchase of goods coming from outside has been prohibited before its arrival on the market so that nobody can exploit the ignorance of the outsiders, and on the other side, villagers are enjoined to sell their goods themselves so that the commission of the broker does not increase the price of the goods. If an urbanite sells the merchandise of any villager on a fair price without charging any commission then this is permissible, as is confirmed by Ahadith. If the people living in cities charge each other commission on the purchase or sale of their goods this is permissible.(@)PageV01P2323(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1776 - وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ لا تتلقوا(@)(@@) السلع حتى يهبط بها إلى

The opinion given by the groups of Ansar and Muhajirun before this Ijtihad was also based on some principles of Shari`ah: those who had advised not to return had evinced submission to the Will of Allah and their absolute trust in Him, and the other group which had preferred the way of precaution had suggested to avoid any such action which could prove harmful.(@)(@@) Although such precautionary measures could not save them from the Divine Decree, they decided to take all possible precautions because this is what is ordained by Allah. In fact, this was the basis of the Ijtihad made by `Umar, the veracity of which was proved by the Hadith of the Prophet (PBUH). This Hadith confirmed the point of view of Imam An- Nawawi. Thus, this Hadith highlights the following four important points:(@)(@@) 1. The test of validity of any decision is its correspondence with Shari`ah.(@)(@@) 2. The desirability of mutual consultation.(@)(@@) 3. The power of the Imam to depart from the advice of the consultative body.(@)(@@) 4.

Anas bin Sirin (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) in the company of some Magians when Faludhaj (a sweet made of flour and honey) was brought in a silver utensil, and Anas did not take it. The man was told to change the utensil. So he changed the utensil and when he brought it to Anas, he took it.(@)(@@) [Al-Baihaqi].(@)(@@) Commentary: From the above narrations, it is clear that the use of utensils made of gold or silver is forbidden in Islam for eating, drinking and for all other purposes. However, medical use of golden or silver wire is not forbidden, e.g., the use of golden wire in securing teeth, or fixing a tooth partly made of gold.(@)(@@) Eating and drinking in utensils of precious metals (in which platinum may also be included) is forbidden as it is a show of pride and exhibition of richness. All such actions are against the basic teachings of Islam. Precious metals should not be used for decoration either.(@)(@@) 1. However, women may use precious metals as ornaments, since according to some narrations there is exemption for the fair sex in this matter. Still some scholars maintain that the chain of such narrations is weak, so they do not allow their use in the ornaments of women as well. Sheikh Al-Albani has discussed this matter in detail in Adab Az- Zafaf and he does not agree with the opinion of these other scholars.(@)(@@) 2. Silken dress is also forbidden for men and, similarly all types of dresses resembling silk are forbidden for them, which are a speciality of women. They are forbidden as creating likeness and resemblance to women. The reason behind this is that the softness and delicacy found in silk is against manliness.(@)(@@) 3. The prohibition of these things reflects the temperament and disposition of Islam. Islam encourages simplicity and piety in eating, drinking, dress and living; and forbids luxury and ease that creates resemblance and likeness with the disbelievers. Alas! Present-day Muslims have adopted ease and luxury and made it the criterion of nobility and are following in the footsteps of the disbelievers. Everyone is busy day and night to attain the western standard of living by hook or by crook. May Allah lead them on the Right Path.(@)PageV01P2356(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 365 - باب تحريم لبس الرجل ثوبا مزعفرا(@)(@@) Chapter 365(@)Prohibition of Wearing Saffron-Colored Dress(@)PageV01P2357(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1798 - عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال : نهى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يتزعفر الرجل . متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1798.
