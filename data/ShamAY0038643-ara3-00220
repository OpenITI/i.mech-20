Qais bin Bishr At-Taghlibi reported that his father, who attended the company of `Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) told him: There was a man in Damascus who was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). He was called Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah. He was a lonesome person and would rarely spend some time in the company of people. He would spend most of his time in performing Salat and when he finished, he would engage himself in Tasbih (Subhan-Allah) and Takbir (Allahu Akbar), till he would go home. He passed by us one day when we were sitting with Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him). The latter said to him: "Tell us something which will benefit for us and will not harm you.'' He said: "Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent a detachment. When they returned, one of them came to the assemblage in which Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was present and said to his neighbour during the conversation: `I wish you had seen us when we encountered the enemy. So-and-so (a believer) took up his spear, struck and said: Take this from me and I am the Ghifari boy. Now what do you think of this?' The neighbour said: `I think that he lost his reward because of boasting.' He said: `I see no harm in it.' They began to exchange arguments till Messenger of Allah (PBUH) heard them and said, `Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from every imperfection). He would be rewarded (in the Hereafter) and praised (in this world)'. I noticed that Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) felt a great pleasure at this remark and, raising his head began to repeat: "Have you heard Messenger of Allah (PBUH) say this!''

Allah hates untidiness.''(@)(@@) [Abu Dawud].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith talks about six points. First, a war cry expressive of one's chivalrous deeds and designed to intimidate the enemy is permissible. Second, it is not an impeachable act and will be rewarded by Allah if it is done with a good intention. Third, hair should be grown either up to the earlobes or up to the neck-end as was the Prophet's practice. The Prophet (PBUH) disapproved the long hair upon the shoulders. Fourth, on return from a journey, a man is advised to clean up his appearance and dust-covered clothes; due to the fatigue and dust of journey, he may appear untidy and out of shape. With his ruffled hair and run-down face, whether intentional or unintentional, he will perhaps give a depressive impression to his wife and children and other family members to the displeasure of Allah. Fifth, we may sympathetically allude to the minor shortcomings of a person in his absence for the sake of his moral uplifting. This will not be considered as backbiting. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) talked about Khuraim Al-Usaidi (May Allah be pleased with him) in the same spirit. Sixth, indecency which means something ugly and disgraceful is taken here in an untidy and dishevelled sense which is against aesthetic principles.(@)PageV01P1015(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 799 - وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ إزرة المسلم إلى نصف الساق ولا حرج أو لا جناح فيما بينه وبين الكعبين ما كان أسفل من الكعبين فهو في النار ومن جر إزاره بطرا لم ينظر الله إليه ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد صحيح(@)(@@) 799.

Others think that the prohibitive order is related only to the untanned hides and is inapplicable to the tanned ones. This opinion also goes since such hides are used by extravagant and arrogant people, and its use by Muslims may hold them analogous to the former. But Imam Ash-Shaukani is of the view that the hides of beasts, whether tanned or untanned, must not be used.

First, to take a bath on Friday is a matter of commendation. Some say this bath is commendable, while others think it is necessary. Second, one should take it in the morning or before going to the mosque to offer prayer. Third, on this occasion the use of perfume or hair-cream is preferable. Fourth, there is a mention of good manners. Instead of crossing over the heads of worshippers, one should try to locate an open space and sit there. To thrust oneself between two sitting persons looks awkward. Fifth, entry into the mosque should be followed by the performance of two Rak`ah prayer, even if the Imam is delivering Khutbah (religious talk). Sixth, an attempt should be made to offer voluntary prayer before the Khutbah. Seventh, complete silence should be observed during the Khutbah to the point that one is not allowed to say to the other person: "Keep silent,'' if one does not want to loose reward. Eighth, if a man offers his Friday prayer by observing the said conditions and prerequisites, his week-long sins will be forgiven by Allah. But these are exclusively minor sins including failure in doing one's duty to Allah. As regards major sins, the sinner will not be forgiven by Allah unless he sincerely repents from the sins. Similarly, a man's failure to do his duties towards his fellow-Muslim brothers or sisters, in case he has wronged them in anyway, will not be pardoned unless he is forgiven by them.(@)PageV01P1057(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 829 - وعن عمرو بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ لا يحل لرجل أن يفرق بين اثنين إلا بإذنهما ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي وقال حديث حسن(@)(@@) وفي رواية لأبي داود : [ لا يجلس بين رجلين إلا بإذنهما ](@)(@@) 829. `Amr bin Shu`aib on the authority of his father and grandfather reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "It is not permissible for a person to sit between two people without their permission.''(@)(@@) [At-Tirmidhi].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith tells us that a man is forbidden to push himself between two sitting persons unless they themselves allow him to do that.(@)PageV01P1058(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 830 - وعن حذيفة بن اليمان رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لعن من جلس وسط الحلقة . رواه أبو داود بإسناد حسن . وروى الترمذي عن أبي مجلز أن رجلا قعد وسط حلقة فقال حذيفة : ملعون على لسان محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أو لعن الله على لسان محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم من جلس وسط الحلقة . قال الترمذي حديث حسن صحيح(@)(@@) 830.

It is heedlessness which prompts man to transgress Divine rules and limits, whereas the remembrance of Allah prevents him from indulging in backbiting and passing slanderous remarks against people in their absence or reproaching and belittling someone at a meeting. Unfortunately, such petty and negative out-pourings are relished at chat sessions in our society. This generates grudge, illwill and hostility in hearts and splits up social cohesion and Islamic solidarity. Every Muslim should, therefore, take care to avoid such gatherings.(@)PageV01P1066(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 130 - باب الرؤيا

In the case of the second, the sense is clear. Yet, Satan may also appear in a believer's dream under a saintly guise and put him into delusion that he has seen Messenger of Allah (PBUH).

A bad dream should be attributed to Satan and not be described to others because it often causes one to be pessimistic and it may be taken as a bad omen, which is not allowed in Islam.

Unfortunately, some unwary `Ulama', particularly the story-telling preachers, frequently indulge in uttering fabricated Ahadith.

These prayers should be recited after the Prophet's practice.(@)PageV01P1160(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 909 - وعن أبي سعيد الخدري وأبي هريرة رضي الله عنهما أنهما شهدا على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال : [ من قال : لا إله إلا الله والله أكبر صدقه ربه فقال : لا إله إلا أنا وأنا أكبر وإذا قال : لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له قال يقول : لا إله إلا أنا وحدي لا شريك لي وإذا قال : لا إله إلا الله له الملك وله الحمد قال : لا إله إلا أنا لي الحمد ولي الملك وإذا قال : لا إله إلا الله ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله قال : لا إله إلا أنا ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بي . وكان يقول : [ من قالها في مرضه ثم مات لم تطعمه النار ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن(@)(@@) 909. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "If a person says: `La ilaha illallahu wallahu Akbar (There is no true god except Allah and Allah is Greatest)', his Rubb responds to him and affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, and I am the Greatest.' When he says: `La ilaha illallahu Wahdahu la sharika Lahu (There is no true god except Allah, the One, He has no partner).' Allah (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I. I have no partner.' When he says: `La ilaha illallahu Lahul mulku wa Lahul-hamdu (the sovereignty belongs to Him and all the praise is due to Him).' He (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, Mine is the praise and to Me belongs the sovereignty.' When he says: `La ilaha illallahu wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no true god except Allah, and there is no might and power but with Allah).' He (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, and there is no might and power but with Me.''' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) added, "He who recites this during his illness and dies, will not be touched by the Fire (Hell).''(@)(@@) [At-Tirmidhu].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith points out the excellence of the words mentioned above. This is so because of great meaning they have, namely the firm belief in Allah, His Oneness and Glorification; that to Him Alone we should return, upon Him Alone we should rely, and to Him Alone we should express gratefulness. If somebody utters them during his illness, his life is sure to come to an end in a good way, that is, he will go to Jannah.(@)PageV01P1161(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 146 - باب استحباب سؤال أهل المريض عن حاله(@)(@@) Chapter 146(@)(@@) Recommendation of Inquiring the Family Members of the Patient about his Condition(@)PageV01P1162(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 910 - عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما أن علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله
