If he does so, he will be eligible to the same reward which is due on Jihad. This would also be a source of increase and growth in his possessions. On the basis of this argument it has been stated that one should always intend to expend his possession on something noble.

Some people might mistakenly think that these two narrations of Sahih Muslim apparently contradict each other because they imply that he who takes part in Jihad and he who provides material to a Mujahid or looks after the family of a Mujahid in his absence from home would get equal reward. For this reason, some people have taken the word "half'' as superfluous thinking that some narrator has added it in the text on his own. But Al- Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the opinion that after the acceptance of the credibility of this Hadith and the proofs furnished in this regard, it is unfair to ascribe addition of any word to the narrator. Its correct interpretation seems to be that when the total reward of it will be evenly distributed between the two, each of them will get the same amount of reward. Hence there is no contradiction in these two Ahadith.(@)(@@) This Hadith also tells us that Jihad is not an express obligation; and if one of the two persons takes part in Jihad, it will suffice for the other also. What can be inferred from this is that the others should take part in Jihad in such a manner that those who have wealth, should arrange for the military requirements of the Mujahidun and look after their families, and in case any Mujahid is martyred, they should provide financial help to his family if it does not have sufficient means for a respectable living.

When the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) realized that they were trapped and there was no chance of their survival, they prayed to Allah to convey their message to the Prophet (PBUH). Their prayer was answered by Allah Who conveyed their message by means of Wahy (Revelation) to the Prophet (PBUH).

Elucidating his order on this point, he stated that by power he meant archery and then he repeated this word three times to stress its importance. He did it because the art of archery had fundamental importance in war at that time. In the present-day world, archery has lost its value as it has been replaced by other inventions like tanks, guns, missiles, atom bombs, etc. Similar is the case of devices which are used in air and naval war, and all these military wares have superb importance in modern warfare. In the present-day context, the injunction of the Noble Qur'an to acquire power means manufacturing and possession of all these devices. It is incumbent on the Muslims that they equip themselves with all this material and show no carelessness in this regard. In modern times, Muslims have badly neglected this field with the result that non-Muslims have more knowledge of modern warfare and by dint of that they are dominating the world and making a claim of their supremacy all over the world. Unless Muslims pursue the Qur'anic injunctions on this score and acquire greater or equal or at least similar measure and style of power, as is possessed by the non-Muslims, they will not be able to check the onslaught of their enemies, and to defeat them.

In the light of this, Imam Al-Qurtubi has stated the principle that if one is not capable of doing some virtuous deeds, he should then make a resolve that whenever he will be capable of it, he will do that deed, so that his intention takes the place of his act.

This Hadith enjoins good treatment of the slaves and contains the elucidation that one should give them the same food and clothes which one has for oneself, or one should give them such wages that they can have the same food and clothes which he has for himself because as far as religion and humanity are concerned, the slaves have the status of one's brother, and their human needs are not different from the needs of their masters. This order also applies to labourers who work in factories, shops and homes. They should be given wages for their work on the strict consideration that they are also human beings and brothers - as if they are members of one's family. It is regrettable indeed that these teachings of Islam have been reglected in the Islamic countries. Not to speak of treating them as brothers, the factory owners, shopkeepers and capitalists of these countries are not prepared to treat them as human beings. The result is that while these employers are rolling in luxury, they do not give to their employees even such wages which can suffice for their human needs. May Allah grant them the ability to act upon the teachings of their religion.(@)(@@) 2.

We find it very common in the present-day Muslim societies.(@)(@@) 4. By issuing the instruction mentioned in this Hadith, Islam has arranged to establish equality in the true sense of the word. Islam does not make any claim of uniting the labour class and weaker segments of the society for confrontation with the capitalists because this breeds class hatred which ruins the peace and progress of the society. Instead of creating enmity, Islam fosters brotherhood between the employer and employed, the master and the slave, the ruler and the ruled. It also exhorts them to be sympathetic and helpful to each other. By stressing the rights of people, it teaches both classes to love and respect each other. This is the reason why in Islam the merit for distinction is not wealth and abundance but Faith and fear of Allah alone which even the poorest of the poor can possess and which may be missing even in the richest of the rich in society.(@)PageV01P1730(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1361 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ إذا أتى أحدكم خادمه بطعامه فإن لم يجلسه معه فليناوله لقمة أو لقمتين أو أكلة أو أكلتين فإنه ولي علاجه ] رواه البخاري(@)(@@) [ الأكلة ] بضم الهمزة : هي اللقمة(@)(@@) 1361.

Those people who will have the privilege of getting in the shade of the Throne will be then very lucky indeed. Among such lucky people, there will be a person who used not only to give loans to the poor and the needy but also gave them convenience in the payment of their debts or would forgive a part of the loan or all of it. This Hadith has food for thought for the affluent. Nowadays people usually lend money to people of their own status and do not like to give loan to the poor because they think that it is difficult to recover from them. As far as remitting a loan is concerned, we have totally forgotten this precept. In any case, to refuse loan to a poor, when a person is in a position to lend money to him, is hateful. To lend money to a needy and then to show him leniency in its payment or to remit it altogether is a praiseworthy act, the best reward for which will be given to him on the Day of Resurrection.

Envy is permissible for the reason that when one seems that a person has been graced by Allah with certain gifts and qualities, he also desires to be blessed with those gifts. In the latter case, he does not grumble and grieve but eagerly prays to Allah for those gifts. `Knowledge' here stands for the knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith because this knowledge alone is beneficial for man, and it is through this knowledge that correct judgements can be made among the people.

Such people benefit from this knowledge themselves and extend this benefit to others also. By virtue of this quality they are the best of all. Second, those people who acquire knowledge and impart it to others, but do not fulfill the requirements of that knowledge. Such people are inferior in rank to the people of the first category and can be taken to task for their omissions. Third, those who shun the knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith. Neither they study and hear the two themselves for their own benefit, nor do they acquire knowledge to impart it to others for their benefit. This is the worst category of people.

It stresses the importance of acquiring knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith and imparting it to others. No matter whether one has more or less knowledge, he must communicate it to others. There is no justification to presume that preaching or inviting to the Message of Allah is the duty of religious scholars and those who are well-versed in this sphere. In fact, it is a duty upon every Muslim, so much so that if a person knows even a single Verse of the Qur'an, that is to say if he knows only one injunction of Allah, he is duty bound to communicate it to other people.(@)(@@) 2. It allows the communication of Jewish Traditions but this permission is subject to the condition that such Traditions are not against the elucidations of the Qur'an and Hadith.(@)(@@) 3. There is a stern warning on attributing any false saying to the Prophet (PBUH). This demands strict scrutiny of Ahadith. If a Hadith does not have a reliable authority or whose chain of narrators has a false link or a person of doubtful integrity, that is to say if it is weak, then it is a serious offense to quote it as a Hadith of the Prophet (PBUH). There are various grades of weakness, and this requires deep knowledge of the narrators and principles of Hadith to know them since scholars who are expert in this discipline are few and far. The safest course for ordinary scholars is to refrain from stating such Ahadith which are weak, no matter whether the weakness is serious or slight. The reason is that although the majority of Muhaddithun consider the slightly weak Ahadith acceptable but they cannot be identified by everybody. Thus, every Hadith which is marked as weak should not be mentioned. In the present age Sheikh Nasiruddin Al-Albani has done a very remarkable work in this field. He has separated the weak Ahadith found in the four famous volumes of Ahadith (Sunnan Abu Dawud, At- Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah) from the authentic and prepared separate volumes of authentic and weak Ahadith. This work of Al-Albani has made it easy for the ordinary `Ulama' to identify the weak Ahadith. Only a man of Sheikh Al-Albani's calibre can do research on it. The ordinary `Ulama' and religious scholars of the Muslims are heavily indebted to him for this great work and they should keep it in view before mentioning any Hadith. They should mention only the authentic Ahadith and refrain from quoting the weak ones. It is wrong to ignore this work on the ground that Sheikh Al-Albani is not the last word on the subject. There can be a possibility of error in his work because it is after all a human effort, but it will be very unfair to regard his effort of no account merely because of a possible error. It is regrettable indeed that only because of this possible error many people refuse to accept even the correctness of the Sahihain. (i.e., Sahih Al- Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). Should we then accept their view? No, certainly not. So there is no sense in not making use of Sheikh Al- Albani's matchless contribution. As Muhaddithun have done a great service to the Muslim Ummah by collecting and compiling the Ahadith, similarly in the style of Muhaddithun, and in keeping with the principles laid down by them, the research carried out to separate the authentic Ahadith from the weak is in fact an effort to complete their mission. In this age, Almighty Allah has bestowed this honour on Sheikh Al-Albani. May Allah protect him, give him the best of the reward and give him a long life.(@)(@@) We now revert to the subject under discussion and say that no such saying and practice should be attributed to the Prophet (PBUH) the authenticity of which is doubtful. On this principle, weak Ahadith, should not be mentioned. It is very unfortunate indeed that in spite of such a stern warning, many of our `Ulama' are not careful in this matter. Not to speak of weak Ahadith, they do not hesitate to mention even Ahadith Maudu`ah forged Ahadith) only to adorn their speech. May Allah guide them to the Right Path. In fact, there is a class of religious scholars who try to refute the authentic Ahadith and validate the weak ones only to add credence to their own juristic school. May Allah save us from such evils.(@)PageV01P1757(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1381 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه

Unfortunately, a fraction of heretics consider such festivities laudable. When the Prophet (PBUH) did not like such gatherings on his own grave, how can it be permissible on the death anniversaries of other people? Some people misinterpret this Hadith and contend that what it means is that `You should not come to my grave once in a while but very frequently'' although its real meaning is that which we have just mentioned. The next sentence confirms this contention. There is no need for frequent gathering for the reason that wherever a Muslim may be, the salutations which he performs to the Prophet (PBUH) will be conveyed to him through the angels. Every Muslim has a desire to visit the Prophet's grave, and there cannot be any doubt about its desirability, but there is no need to undertake journey for paying homage and salutation only. In fact, the real intention of going to Al-Madinah should be to visit Prophet's Mosque which will include visiting his grave. This is the real meaning of this Hadith. There is another Hadith which prohibits undertaking a journey to any mosque except the three which have been marked by the Prophet (PBUH).(@)PageV01P1784(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1402 - وعنه رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ ما من أحد يسلم علي إلا رد الله علي روحي حتى أرد عليه السلام ] رواه أبو

But this life of his is the life of Barzakh (an intervening state between death and the Day of Resurrection, and whoever dies, enters it) the reality of which is not known to us. Thus, it is wrong to say that the life of the Prophet (PBUH) is like worldly life or more vigorous than it. Such a claim is baseless because it is not confirmed by the Qur'an and Hadith. Were he to be alive the way he was in his lifetime, there would have been no need for "the returning of the soul to his body'' and he would be able to answer the salutations without it. As far this ambiguity is concerned, when countless Muslims are always offering salutations to the Prophet (PBUH) how does the return of the soul takes place after such short intervals? Such questions arise due to the lack of certitude in the Omnipotence of Allah. When the Prophet (PBUH) stated that his soul is returned to him then we should have absolute faith in his statement because Allah is Capable of doing every thing. What is its nature and form, it is not known to us, nor can we know it. Thus, the question of the return of soul in the grave should be considered similar to the ambiguous Ayat of the Qur'an in which every Muslim is required to have blind faith but their secret is known to Allah Alone.(@)(@@) This Hadith has an inducement for offering more and more supplications for the Prophet (PBUH) so that the devotee is blessed with the maximum reward in the form of the Prophet's response to his salutations. It is certainly a great blessing which a Muslim should try every nerve to achieve.(@)PageV01P1785(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1403 - وعن علي رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ البخيل من ذكرت عنده فلم يصل علي ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن صحيح(@)(@@) 1403. `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me.''(@)(@@) [At-Tirmidhi].(@)(@@) Commentary: "Miser'' means to deny someone his right.
