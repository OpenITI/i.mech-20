Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim (PBUH) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (PBUH), while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il's mother followed him saying: "O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?'' She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: "Has Allah commanded you to do so?'' He said: "Yes.'' She said: "Then He will not neglect us.'' She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both hands and supplicated: "O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as- Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.'' (14:37).(@)(@@) Isma`il's mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.'' Ibn `Abbas further related: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "This is the source of the tradition of the Sa`y - i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she exclaimed: `Shshs!' (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me hear your voice; have you any succour for me?' And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out until she had scooped some of it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "May Allah bestow mercy on Isma'il's mother! Had she let the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah will never let neglected His people.' The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "Isma`il's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied: `Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "Isma`il's mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their daughters in marriage. After Isma`il's mother had died, Ibrahim came after Isma`il's marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il's wife about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and destitution.' He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.' When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?' She replied: `Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.' Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he advise you anything?' She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.' Isma`il said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il's wife and asked her about him. She said: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Ibrahim asked her about their sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?' She replied: `We are prosperous and well off.' Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim asked: `What kind of food do you eat?' She said: `Meat.' He said: `What do you drink?' She said: `Water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and water!''' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in Makkah.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il's wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his door.' When Isma`il came back, he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?' She replied: `Yes, a good looking old man came to me.' She praised him and added: `He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in good condition.' Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you a piece of advice?' She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.' On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.' Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father. Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.' Isma`il said: `Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.' Ibrahim asked: `Will you help me?' Isma`il said: `I will help you.' Ibrahim said: `Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.''' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) added, "Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high, Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us! Verily, You are the All-Hearer and the All-Knower.'''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) There are some more narrations about this incident, some adding details and some with minor variations in the wordings.(@)(@@) Commentary:(@)(@@) 1. In this narration, there is the historical background of walking briskly between the hills of As-Safa and Al-Marwah. This ritual of Hajj and `Umrah has been fixed as a remembrance of the incident about what Hajirah (May Allah be pleased with her) had to face and what she did in the difficult circumstances. In fact, she was so pious and obedient that she agreed to live in such wilderness where there was no sign of any human being far and wide. Secondly, there was no water to drink or food for subsistence.(@)(@@) For this act of piety, she was rewarded with two things; firstly, she was bestowed with an eternally flowing spring which proved for her at that moment a source of life, and people still benefit from it today. Secondly, her brisk movement and running between the two hills was made an important and compulsory ritual to be performed during Hajj and `Umrah. This ritual is to continue for all times till the Day of Resurrection.(@)(@@) 2. Ka`bah was built by Prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Isma`il.(@)(@@) 3.

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim] Commentary: Al-Manna is the famous kind of food which Allah bestowed upon Banu Israel. As-Salwa was a kind of bird resembling the quail. It was slaughtered and then eaten. Al-Manna was a sweet substance which appeared on the trees or stones. It was sweet like honey and after drying, it took the form of gum. According to others, it was honey or sweet water (Tafsir Ahsan-ul-Bayan). The truffle is similar to Al-Manna. This means that as Banu Israel were given food without toil, so we find truffle in nature without effort. The juice of truffle is useful in curing some diseases of the eye. This prescription was suggested by the Prophet (PBUH). It is surely beneficial.(@)PageV01P2436(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) | AUTO 19- كتاب الاستغفار(@)(@@) Book Nineteen: The Book of Forgiveness(@)PageV01P2437(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 371 - باب(@)(@@) Chapter 371(@)(@@) Seeking Forgiveness PageV01P2438 قال الله تعالى ( محمد 19 ) : { واستغفر لذنبك وللمؤمنين والمؤمنات }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النساء 106 ) : { واستغفر الله إن الله كان غفورا رحيما }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النصر 3 ) : { فسبح بحمد ربك واستغفره إنه كان توابا }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( آل عمران 15 ) : { للذين اتقوا عند ربهم جنات } إلى قوله عز وجل { والمستغفرين بالأسحار }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النساء 110 ) : { ومن يعمل سوءا أو يظلم نفسه ثم يستغفر الله يجد الله غفورا رحيما }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الأنفال 33 ) : { وما كان الله ليعذبهم وأنت فيهم وما كان الله معذبهم وهم يستغفرون }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( آل عمران 135 ) : { والذين إذا فعلوا فاحشة أو ظلموا أنفسهم ذكروا الله فاستغفروا لذنوبهم ومن يغفر الذنوب إلا الله ولم يصروا على ما فعلوا وهم يعلمون }(@)(@@) والآيات في الباب كثيرة معلومة(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "And ask forgiveness for your sin...''

Similarly, her pulse and blood pressure are also altered. Females are also more prone to hysteria.

Modern researches have proved this rule to be correct on the basis of biology, psychology and embryology.(@)(@@) Again we know that physically speaking, the female has been named as the weaker sex. For these reasons, females have been excused from earning their livelihood. For earning livelihood, one may have to go out and work hard. Women have been exempted from this duty because of their biological differences and other considerations of Shari`ah. Present-day women who are ignorant of Islam and modern researches are not prepared to accept these scientifically and religiously proved facts. The West claims equality between the sexes. But this equality has not been established so far. Today all the important posts are occupied by males and all the international policies are framed by them alone. Even matters pertaining to women are decided by them. They have mostly relegated them to the posts of workers, secretaries and stenographers for their sexual satisfaction and enjoyment. After a struggle for hundred years, their condition today proves that they are the weaker sex.(@)(@@) So, it is both beneficial and more respectful for her to limit herself to the sphere of action suggested for her by Islam.

At-Tufail bin Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I used to visit `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) in the morning and accompany him to the market. `Abdullah offered greetings of peace to every one he met on the way, be they sellers of petty goods, traders or poor people. One day when I came to him, he asked me to accompany him to the market. I said to him: "What is the point of your going to the market when you do not sell, nor ask about articles, nor offer a price for them, nor sit down with any company of people. Let us sit down here and talk.'' He replied: "O Abu Batn (belly)!

When a man meets a brother or a friend, should he bow to him?'' He said, "No.'' The man asked whether he should embrace and kiss him? The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) replied, "No.'' He asked whether he should hold his hand and shake it?

Some say the bowing must not come down to the position as assumed in Ruku`. But the Hadith imposes a total ban on it. There is no question of more or less degree of bowing, still less of touching the knees and feet of anybody. Here embracing has been prohibited too, but the prohibition is effective only if the kissing of hands is also involved. Otherwise, some Ahadith allow embracing, particularly on return from a journey or when two persons meet after a long time. Thirdly, the Hadith is absolutely clear on handshake. The question put to the Prophet u was about taking a single hand to which he had replied in the affirmative. There was no reference to taking or using both hands for handshake.(@)PageV01P1137(@)(@)(@@) [ ( 1 ) افتلتت نفسها : أي توفيت(@)(@)(@@) ( 2 ) وهو نص صريح في جواز بل سنية التصدق عن الميت ولا يجادل في ذلك إلا مبتدع ذو هوى أو جاهل مدع { . . . وهم يحسبون أنهم يحسنون صنعا } . { ربنا لا تزغ قلوبنا بعد إذ هديتنا وهب لنا من لدنك رحمة إنك أنت الوهاب }(@)(@)(@@) ومثله الحج عن الغير مشروع كذلك بنص السنة وهو يشتمل على جميع الطاعات من إحرام وطواف ووقوف بعرفة وصلاة وهدي وصدقة وأذكار وغيرها . . . ونصه الحديث رقم 1279 : . . . أن امرأة قالت : يا رسول الله إن فريضة الله على عباده في الحج أدركت أبي شيخا كبيرا لا يثبت على الراحلة أفأحج عنه ؟ قال : [ نعم ] متفق عليه . والحديث رقم 1280 عن لقيط بن عامر رضي الله عنه أنه أتى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال : إن أبي شيخ كبير لا يستطيع الحج ولا العمرة ولا الظعن ؟ قال : [ حج عن أبيك واعتمر ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي وقال حديث حسن صحيح(@)(@)(@@) ومنه يستنتج جواز القيام عن الغير بجميع أنواع البر والطاعات إلا ما استثني صريحا أو ما كان خلاف إرادة الميت كما يدل قول الصحابي هنا : وأراها لو تكلمت تصدقت(@)(@)(@@) دار الحديث ](@)(@)(@@) 948. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: A man said to the Prophet (PBUH): "My mother has died suddenly. I think that if she were able to talk (alive) she would have given in Sadaqah (charity). So, if I give Sadaqah now on her behalf, will she get the reward?'' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Yes (she will be rewarded for that).''(@)(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith plainly tells us that the reward of the alms given on behalf of a dead person reaches his or her soul just like the benefit of prayer, if accepted by Allah. Charity and prayer are two permissible forms of the transmission of blessing to the dead. But rites like `Qul' and `Chehlum' are all of Hindu origin to which the ignorant Muslims have taken a fancy. Similarly, Qur'an reading meant to transmit reward to a dead man's soul is against the Prophet's example. All such observances are of no use to the dead. Only scriptural channels can be beneficial to them and they are only two - prayer and charity. But only that charity counts which comes from the children of the dead and the Hadith too has specified it. Obviously, almsgiving by any other person than the offspring cannot be considered rightful or rewarding to the dead. For further detail, one can refer to Sheikh Al-Albani's Ahkam-ul- Janaiz.(@)PageV01P1220(@)(@)(@@) [ ( 1 ) قال في القاموس : السرى كالهدى : سير عامة الليل ](@)(@)(@@) Chapter 168(@)(@)(@@) Etiquette of Staying, Riding, Encamping at night and sleeping during the Journey and other matters relating to the Journey(@)PageV01P1240(@)(@)(@@) ( 1 ) مخطومة : أي مجعول في رأسها الخطام(@)(@)(@@) 1331.
