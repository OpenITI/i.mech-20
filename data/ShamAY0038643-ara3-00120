He should not be a non- practising Muslim. Nowadays, we have an abundance of Imam but many of them are neither pious nor faithfully act upon religious teachings. In any case, where we can find a Qari who fulfills the requirements just mentioned, he deserves first preference for appointment as Imam. Even a religious scholar will come next to him. It must be borne in mind that nice recitation of the Noble Qur'an does not mean its recitation with great skill, but its essentials are elegant voice, acquaintance with the `Ilm-ut-Tajwid (or science of reciting the Qur'an), clear and distinct recitation.(@)(@@) 2.

Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Will you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man?'' And mentioned the rest of the Hadith.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: The author of this book, Imam Nawawi, has reproduced only that portion of Hadith which is related to this chapter. This Hadith makes out the following points:(@)(@@) 1. The eldest person has the first right to speak in a gathering. But this principle is to be followed when all the persons present there are equal in virtue and intelligence; otherwise, one who is superior to others in these qualities will have a prior right to speak.(@)(@@) 2. The Hadith explains the issue of Qasamah which was in vogue in the pre-Islamic period and was maintained by Islam. Qasamah was a mode of settling cases of undetected murders. In such situations, fifty persons from the heirs of the victim were asked to take an oath that murder was committed by some person of that locality (or some persons from the heirs were required to take oath for fifty times to this effect); after this oath, the people of that area were liable to pay Diyah (blood money) to the heirs of the victim. If the persons blamed for the murder said on the similar oath that none of them had committed that offense, they were absolved from the payment of Diyah and the payment of blood money was made to the heirs of the victim from the Bait-ul-Mal (state exchequer). In the incident referred in this Hadith when the Prophet (PBUH) asked the brothers of the victim to take the required oath, they refused to do so as they were not sure as to who had committed the crime. The Prophet (PBUH) did not ask the inhabitants of Khaibar for the oath because they were Jews and the heirs of the victim did not have faith in them. Thus, the Prophet (PBUH) himself made the payment of the blood money to the heirs of the victim.(@)PageV01P439(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 352 - وعن جابر رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يجمع بين الرجلين من قتلى أحد ( يعني في القبر ) ثم يقول : [ أيهما أكثر أخذا للقرآن ؟ ] فإذا أشير له إلى أحدهما قدمه في اللحد . رواه البخاري(@)(@@) 352.

The grave which is straight, a common type, is called Darih. This Hadith tells about the distinction of the Hafiz and his superiority over others.

Their love was full of obedience and submission to Allah in the true sense. This is what the bedouin mentioned in this Hadith really meant when he said that he had not amassed a large treasure by way of Salat, Saum (fasts) and Sadaqah for presentation on the Day of Resurrection. What he meant by them was voluntary acts and not the obligations. The reason being that the obligatory acts like Salat, Saum and Zakat are incumbent on every Muslim and no one can claim to be a true believer and lover of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH) who ignores them. Any Muslim who entertains true love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH), makes it evident in his practical life by his strict performance of the duties and obligations enjoined by Allah and demonstrated by His Prophet (PBUH) through his Sunnah. Even if such a person does not have to his credit a large amount of voluntary acts, he will be declared successful by Allah. This is the real import of this Hadith, otherwise a Muslim's claim for the love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH) will be void if he does not fulfill his religious obligations. In fact, without the fulfillment of religious obligations, his claim will be nothing short of self-deception. His claim for the love of Allah and His Prophet (PBUH), which is not supported by his actions will carry no weight before Allah. This is what the following Ayah of the Noble Qur'an enjoins: "Say (O Muhammad (PBUH) to mankind:) `If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e., accept Islamic Tauhid, follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive your sins.

It means that except for Faith and piety, favoured of Allah are neither people of the special kind nor have they any special distinctive signs, as is generally thought by some people. In this respect, the ignorance of the general public is shocking because they regard even such persons as favoured of Allah who not only neglect the religious obligations and the practice of the Prophet (PBUH), but also woefully lack cleanliness. Sometimes they call even mad or half-mad persons as favourites of Allah, whereas a Wali in the true sense is one who is meticulous about observing the obligations and is fearful of Allah.(@)(@@) This Hadith brings about the following four points:(@)(@@) Firstly, the love of those whom Allah loves entail the love of Allah, and hating them entails the hatred of Allah..(@)(@@) Secondly, when a true Muslim acquires nearness and love of Allah by means of performing religious obligations, supererogatory and voluntary prayers, Allah then becomes his special helper and protects his limbs and organs and does not let them work for His disobedience. Then he does not use any part of his body for things which are disliked by Him. It is wrong to infer from this Hadith, as men of heretical and polytheistic trend try to do, that Auliya' become the eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc. of Allah. That is to say that Almighty Allah descends in them. Thus, on the basis of this contemptible reasoning, they conclude that it makes no difference whether one begs from Allah or Auliya because the two are one being. For such people supplicating "O Allah! Help us'', "O Prophet of Allah! Help us'' and "O Ali! Help us'' etc., are all right. One who says so has certainly gone astray, rather commits Shirk (polytheism). May Allah save us from these sins. According to the Hadith, a true pious man likes and adopts what is liked by Allah, and avoids all such things which are not liked by Him.(@)(@@) Thirdly, the performance of the obligatory acts of worshipping has the first and foremost importance for attaining the pleasure of Allah because their fulfillment is liked the most by Allah and also because they furnish the foundation, on which the edifice of Islam is built. As we cannot think of a building without foundation, similarly, we cannot think of voluntary worship without fulfilling the basic obligations. The fact is that one who neglects them ceases to be a Muslim. This is the reason for the severe warnings of Allah to those who default on this account. Those who neglect voluntary prayers have not been given any warning. It is, however, true that their performance in addition to the obligatory ones increases lustre of obligations. Nawafil (voluntary acts of worship) help one to attain the exalted place of being loved by Allah by virtue of which one is endowed with the special Help of Allah.(@)(@@) Fourthly, Almighty Allah certainly grants the prayers of those whom He loves. But acceptance of their prayers, however, does not mean that their results appear at once. Sometime the results of these prayers appear after a long time. The prayer of virtuous persons is certainly granted but whether it takes a long or short time depends solely on the Will of Allah.(@)PageV01P480(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 387 - وعنه رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ إذا أحب الله تعالى العبد نادى جبريل إن الله يحب فلانا فأحبوه . فيحبه أهل السماء ثم يوضع له القبول في الأرض ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) وفي رواية لمسلم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ إن الله تعالى إذا أحب عبدا دعا جبريل فقال : إني أحب فلانا فأحبه . فيحبه جبريل ثم ينادي في السماء فيقول : إن الله يحب فلانا فأحبوه . فيحبه أهل السماء ثم يوضع له القبول في الأرض . وإذا أبغض عبدا دعا جبريل فيقول : إني أبغض فلانا فأبغضه . فيبغضه جبريل ثم ينادي في أهل السماء : إن الله يبغض فلانا فأبغضوه . فيبغضه أهل السماء ثم توضع له البغضاء في الأرض ](@)(@@) 387.

The objective of Jihad. This objective warrants that one must struggle against Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (polytheism) and the worship of falsehood in all its forms. Jihad has to continue until this objective is achieved. This contention is supported by a Hadith, to the effect that Jihad will continue till the Day of Resurrection. In this Hadith the word (An-Nas) translated above as "people" stands for the polytheists and idolaters. The reason being that other Nasus (pl. of Nass, meaning `text') confirm the exemption of Ahl-ul-Kitab (people of the Scriptures) from it subject to the condition that they agree to pay Jizyah (dues imposed by Islam on the people of the Book living under the protection of an Islamic state) and submit to the Muslim rule. The Arab pagans have only the choice to either embrace Islam or face war. In the latter case, it is incumbent on the Mulsims to wage Jihad against them to wipe out Kufr and Shirk and raise the banner of Tauhid everywhere.(@)(@@) This Hadith strongly refutes the people who distort the Islamic concept of Jihad and hold that Islam preaches defensive war only. It is an apologetic approach because defensive war has to be fought in any case by every nation and country. Thus, it is a compulsion and needs no justification. The real distinction of Islam lies in its enjoining Muslims to wage war for upholding the truth beside fighting for their own defense. The domination of Kufr, Shirk and falsehood is darkness, heresy and tyranny, and the objective of Islam is to purge the world of all these evils. It aims at liberating man from the worship of man, set them on the path of worship of Allah, and to provide a just and equitable society to mankind. Wherever in the world there is tyranny, ignorance and heresy, Muslims are bound to fight such evils and finish them by means of Jihad.(@)(@@) There is also a third form of Jihad which is waged against countries where Muslims are victims of aggression, suppression and cruelties of the non-Muslims. It is incumbent upon Muslims to liberate their brethren in Faith from the clutches of the non-Muslims by means of Jihad. So long Muslims performed this obligation with a sense of duty, Islam and its followers were dominant in the world and ever since they have ignored this obligation, both are in subjugation and disgrace. In other words, the secret of power and stability of Muslims lies in Jihad. Muslims need to understand this secret like their ancestors.(@)(@@) 2. Life and property of every person is secured after his joining the fold of Islam. He will, however, be subject to the law of Islam, one of which is payment of Zakat. If he murders any Muslim, he will also be killed in return, unless the heirs of the victim pardon the murderer or accept blood-money (Diyah) for it.(@)(@@) 3. When a person embraces Islam, the laws of Shari`ah apply to him according to his apparent condition only. His heart will not be probed for this purpose. In case, he is not sincere or he has some design in joining the fold of Islam, no action will be taken against him until guilt is fully proved. What he has in his heart will be left to Allah Who will pass judgement on his intention on the Day of Resurrection. This Hadith is related to this chapter for its third point. In their debate on this point, some `Ulama' have contended that such people who believe in Tauhid and obey the injunctions of Shari`ah are not to be declared as infidels.(@)PageV01P488(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 391 - وعن أبي عبد الله طارق بن أشيم رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ من قال لا إله إلا الله وكفر بما

If, in spite of knowing that his life and property are sacred, a Muslim murders him, then it will be quite fair for the heirs of the victim to have Qisas for the murder. If the murderer poses ignorance or takes shelter of some reason, then he will be liable for Diyah only. The Prophet (PBUH) arranged payment of Diyah to the heirs of the victim in the case mentioned in this Hadith because some of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) had advanced the argument that the murderer had slain the victim on the presumption that he had professed Islam just to save his life.(@)PageV01P490(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 393 - وعن أسامة بن زيد رضي الله عنه قال : بعثنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى الحرقة من جهينة فصبحنا القوم على مياههم ولحقت أنا ورجل من الأنصار رجلا منهم فلما غشيناه قال : لا إله إلا الله . فكف عنه الأنصاري وطعنته برمحي حتى قتلته . فلما قدمنا بلغ ذلك النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال لي : [ يا أسامة أقتلته بعد ما قال لا إله إلا الله ؟ ] قلت : يا رسول الله إنما كان متعوذا . فقال : [ أقتلته بعد ما قال لا إله إلا الله ؟ ] فما زال يكررها علي حتى تمنيت أني لم أكن أسلمت قبل ذلك اليوم . متفق عليه(@)(@@) وفي رواية : فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ أقال لا إله إلا الله وقتلته ؟ ] قلت : يا رسول الله إنما قالها خوفا من السلاح . قال : [ أفلا شققت عن قلبه حتى تعلم أقالها أم لا ؟ ] فما زال يكررها حتى تمنيت أني أسلمت يومئذ(@)(@@) [ الحرقة ] بضم الحاء المهملة وفتح الراء : بطن من جهينة القبيلة المعروفة(@)(@@) وقوله [ متعوذا ] : أي معتصما بها من القتل لا معتقدا لها(@)(@@) 393.

In order to rule out the possibility of any such mischief, probing into the true condition of the heart is ruled out.

What it means is that Almighty Allah already knows about every person, whether he will be pious or impious, whether he will go to Jannah or Hell. He has already recorded all this. But it does not mean that man is absolutely helpless and is deprived of will and power, as is believed by some deviant sects who have gone astray. Fate is in fact a manifestation of the Knowledge of Allah and it has nothing to do with the will and intention of a person. Allah has not created man as a helpless creature, but has endowed him with the freedom of will and action, because in the absence of these two qualities, there would be no justification for his trial. He could only be put to test if he was granted not only the ability to choose between good and evil but also the freedom to act. For this purpose, Almighty Allah, has clearly indicated to man both the paths and granted him freedom to choose whichever he likes. He has also told him the ultimate end of each.

Since nobody knows the result of his endeavours, one should leave it to Allah and rest assured that He Who has created him with a purpose will also create the ways and means to attain it. He who adopts piety, the ways to piety will open for him; and he who adopts evil, the ways to evil will open for him.(@)(@@) A Muslim should never go towards evil at any stage of his life, lest his life comes to an end suddenly and he is deprived of the reward of all the good deeds he has done during his life and consequently he is consigned to Hell rather than Jannah.

It shows that for the determination of real meanings of this Hadith we shall have to keep in view other related arguments as well. These meanings are riveted with good deeds. In other words, one who bears witness to Tauhid and Risalah and fulfills Islamic injunctions and obligations and requirements of Faith and fear of Allah, will not be consigned to Hell. Some scholars are of the opinion that this Hadith refers to such people who truly repented and renounced Kufr and Shirk and wholeheartedly professed Tauhid and Risalah but died soon after that and thus did not get an opportunity to do good deeds.

Messenger of Allah (PBUH) agreed and called for leather mat and had it spread out, and asked people to bring the provisions left over. They started doing it. One brought a handful of corn, another brought a handful of dates, a third brought a piece of bread; thus some provisions were collected on the mat. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) invoked blessings, and then said, "Now take it up in your vessels". Everyone filled his vessel with food, so that there was not left a single empty vessel in the whole camp.

It was difficult for the Prophet (PBUH) to discover who was absent except that he was informed about him by Allah.'' (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Kitab Al-Maghazi, Bab Ghazwah Tabuk, Hadith Ka`b bin Malik).

Similarly, the one who is superior in virtue should listen to the advice of those who are inferior to him because there is every possibility that their advice may offer something better. It does not harm either of them.

We learn from this Hadith that kind and compassionate treatment is liked by Allah and is in fact His Blessing and Benevolence. This is the reason He has given a part of it to His creatures, and a person who is so hard-hearted, that he is not even aware of it has a defect which is extremely displeasing to Allah. Moreover, it is a sign that such a person is deprived of Divine blessing and mercy.(@)(@@) 2. On the Day of Resurrection, Almighty Allah will bestow upon the believers hundred mercies. This news has great hopes and joy for His slaves.(@)PageV01P522(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 421 - وعنه رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فيما يحكي عن ربه تعالى قال : [ أذنب عبد ذنبا فقال : اللهم اغفر لي ذنبي . فقال الله تبارك وتعالى : أذنب عبدي ذنبا فعلم أن له ربا يغفر الذنب ويأخذ بالذنب . ثم عاد فأذنب فقال : أي رب اغفر لي ذنبي . فقال تبارك وتعالى : أذنب عبدي ذنبا فعلم أن له ربا يغفر الذنب ويأخذ بالذنب . ثم عاد فأذنب فقال : أي رب اغفر لي ذنبي . فقال تبارك وتعالى : أذنب عبدي ذنبا فعلم أن له ربا يغفر الذنب ويأخذ بالذنب قد غفرت لعبدي فليفعل ما شاء ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) وقوله تعالى : [ فليفعل ما شاء ] : أي ما دام يفعل هكذا يذنب ويتوب أغفر له فإن التوبة تهدم ما قبلها(@)(@@) 421. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious said: `A slave committed a sin and he said: O Allah, forgive my sin,' and Allah said: `My slave committed a sin and then he realized that he has a Rubb Who forgives the sins and punishes for the sin.' He then again committed a sin and said: `My Rubb, forgive my sin,' and Allah (SWT) said: `My slave committed a sin and then realized that he has a Rubb Who forgives his sin and punishes for the sin.' He again committed a sin and said: `My Rubb, forgive my sin,' and Allah (SWT) said: `My slave has committed a sin and then realized that he has a Rubb Who forgives the sin or takes (him) to account for sin. I have granted forgiveness to my slave. Let him do whatever he likes".(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) The last sentence "let him do..". means, as long he keeps asking for forgiveness after the commission of sins, and repents, Allah will forgive him because repentance eliminates previous sins". (Editor's Note)(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith tells us that so long as the heart of a Muslim remains free from willful disobedience of Divine injunctions and he does not deliberately neglect his religious duties, that is to say he goes on committing sins and each time wholeheartedly begs pardon for them, Almighty, Allah will forgive him. The reason being that he is penitent for his wrongs and does not insist upon them for fear of accountability. This condition of his shows that his heart is full of awe and Majesty of Allah and he does not feel any disgrace in showing his utter humbleness before Him. Now this is a merit of the sinful which is pleasing to Allah. Thus, He says that so long as his slave continues submission and prostration He will go on forgiving him.(@)(@@) On the contrary, there is a person who goes on committing sins but he neither repents for them nor seeks pardon for his wrongs; nor has any fear of accountability. Obviously, he is altogether different from the kind of Muslims mentioned before, and he will be therefore treated differently by Allah. The conduct of the former is of a Muslim who, in spite of his sins, is liked by Allah while the second is of that of a rebel for whom He has kept severe punishment ready. May Allah rank us among the former category of people.(@)PageV01P523(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 422 - وعنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ والذي نفسي بيده لو لم تذنبوا لذهب الله بكم وجاء بقوم يذنبون فيستغفرون الله تعالى فيغفر لهم ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 422. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, were you not to commit sins, Allah would replace you with a people who would commit sins and then seek forgiveness from Allah; and Allah would forgive them".(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith also tells us that Allah has a profound liking for such people who are penitent and seek pardon for their sins from Him. So much so that if such people cease to exist who neither commit sins nor seek pardon from Him, He will create people who will do so. It does not, however, mean that He likes sins or the sinful persons. What it really means is that He likes penitence and the penitents. This is the true purport of this Hadith.(@)(@@) It also means that it is natural for man to commit sins, and that Allah loves whenever a slave commits a sin to rush and beg for His forgiveness.
