He (PBUH) welcomed her saying, "Welcome, O my daughter'', and made her sit on his right side, or on his left side and then whispered something to her at which she wept bitterly. When he perceived her grief, he talked secretly to her again and she smiled (with happiness). I said to her: "Messenger of Allah (PBUH chose you from amongst all his wives to speak secretly to you and yet you cried.'' When he left, I asked her, "What did Messenger of Allah (PBUH) say to you?'' She said, "I will not divulge the secret of Messenger of Allah (PBUH).'' When Messenger of Allah (PBUH) passed away, I said to her: "I adjure you by the right I have in respect of you to tell me what Messenger of Allah (PBUH) had told you.'' She said: "Now (when Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has died), I will tell you. When he whispered to me the first time, he told me, `Jibril (Gabriel) used to listen to my recitation of the Qur'an and then recite it back to me once or twice a year, and this time he has done it twice; and so I perceive that my death is approaching. Then be mindful of your duty to Allah and be patient and steadfast, for I shall be an excellent predecessor for you.' On this I wept as you saw. When he perceived my distress he talked to me secretly the second time and said, `O Fatimah, are you not pleased that you will be the chief among the believing women or of this Ummah?' This made me smile as you saw.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith, too, has an implication for keeping a secret and concealing it from people. Moreover, we learn that one can spontaneously weep over hearing a sorrowful occurrence and also that we should be patient in distress. The Hadith also teaches us not to feel proud upon receiving a blessing. Above all, the excellence of Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) and the advisability of reading the Qur'an are brought into our focus.(@)PageV01P855(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 688 - وعن ثابت عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال : أتى علي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأنا ألعب مع الغلمان فسلم علينا فبعثني في حاجة فأبطأت على أمي . فلما جئت قالت : ما حبسك ؟ قلت : بعثني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لحاجة . قالت : ما حاجته ؟ قلت : إنها سر . قالت : لا تخبرن بسر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أحدا . قال أنس : والله لو حدثت به أحدا لحدثتك به يا ثابت . رواه مسلم وروى البخاري بعضه مختصرا(@)(@@) 688.

Thirdly, Muslims are prohibited from consulting soothsayers. Fourthly, belief in bad omens is also prohibited. Divinations and presages were the popular fallacies of Arabs in the pre-Islamic epoch.

Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One day, I performed my Wudu' in my house and then set forth with the determination that I would stick to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and spend the whole day with him. I came to the mosque and asked about him. The Companions told that he (PBUH) had gone in a certain direction. Abu Musa added: I followed him inquiring until I came to Bi'r Aris (a well in the suburb of Al-Madinah). (There) I sat down at the door till he (PBUH) had relieved himself and performed Wudu'. Then I went to him and saw him sitting on the platform of the well with his shanks uncovered and his legs dangling in the well. I greeted him and returned to the door of the garden, saying to myself, "I will be the doorkeeper of the Messenger of Allah today.'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came and knocked at the door. I said; "Who is that?'' He said: "Abu Bakr.'' I said, "Wait a moment.'' Then I went to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and said, "O Messenger of Allah! Abu Bakr is at the door seeking permission to enter.'' He said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of Jannah.'' I returned and said to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him): "You may enter and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has given you the glad tidings of (entering) Jannah.'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came in and sat down on the right side of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and suspended his legs into the well and uncovered his shanks, as the Messenger of Allah had done. I returned to the door and sat down. I had left my brother at home while he was performing Wudu' and intending to join me. I said to myself: "If Allah intends good for him (i.e., to be blessed to come at this time and receive the glad tidings of entering Jannah), He will bring him here.'' Someone knocked at the door and I said, "Who is it?'' He said, "Umar bin Al-Khattab.'' I said, "Wait a moment.'' Then I proceeded towards Messenger of Allah (PBUH). I greeted him and said, "Umar is at the door, seeking permission to enter. He said, "Let him in and give him the glad tidings of entering Jannah.'' I went back to `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him, "Messenger of Allah has given you permission as well as glad tidings of entering Jannah.'' He entered and sat down with Messenger of Allah (PBUH) on his left side and dangled his feet into the well. I returned to the door and sat down and said to myself: "If Allah intends good for my brother, He will bring him here.'' Someone knocked at the door and I said, "Who is it?'' He said, "Uthman bin `Affan.'' I said, "Wait a moment.'' I went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and informed him about his arrival. He said, "Let him in and give him glad tidings of entering Jannah together with a tribulation which he will have to face.'' I came back to him and said, "You may enter; and Messenger of Allah (PBUH) gives you the glad tidings of entering Jannah together with a tribulation that will afflict you.'' He got in and saw that the elevated platform round the well was fully occupied. So he sat on opposite side.

When `Uthman was told (about the misfortune) he praised Allah then said: "Allahu Musta`an (His help is to be sought).''(@)(@@) (The interpretation of Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab is that the graves of Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) are by the side of the Prophet (PBUH), in the same position they took when they sat next to the Prophet (PBUH) while the grave of `Uthman is away from their graves, in the public graveyard of Al-Madinah known as Baqi` Al-Gharqad).(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith brings four points under our consideration. First, in certain cases, a glad tiding is given about the future life. Second, the Prophet (PBUH) himself gave the good news to the first three Rightly-Guided Khulafa' (caliphs) that they would go to Jannah. Now only an inborn wretch can doubt their Faith. Third, the riot foretold by the Prophet (PBUH) with regard to `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) took place in the concluding days of his caliphate. Influenced by the wicked and baseless propaganda of a Jew, `Abdullah bin Saba', a splinter group blockaded `Uthman's house and finally put him to death. The incident reveals the Prophet's truthfulness. Fourth, things are also interpreted while one is awake, and the power of intuition is of course the basis of such a state. Yet, a vision is not necessarily commensurate with the external reality in all cases. However, the first two caliphs, as envisioned by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him), are eternally resting, along with the Prophet (PBUH), in `Aishah's room, while `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) is buried in the Al- Madinan graveyard of Baqi` Al-Gharqad.(@)PageV01P895(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 710 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال : كنا قعودا حول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ومعنا أبو بكر وعمر رضي الله عنهما في نفر فقام رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من بين أظهرنا فأبطأ علينا وخشينا أن يقتطع دوننا وفزعنا فقمنا فكنت أول من فزع فخرجت أبتغي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حتى أتيت حائطا للأنصار لبني النجار فدرت به هل أجد له بابا فلم أجد فإذا ربيع يدخل في جوف حائط من بئر خارجة ( والربيع : الجدول الصغير ) فاحتفزت فدخلت على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم . فقال : [ أبو هريرة ؟ ] فقلت : نعم يا رسول الله . قال : [ ما شأنك ؟ ] قلت : كنت بين ظهرينا فقمت فأبطأت علينا فخشينا أن تقتطع دوننا ففزعنا فكنت أول من فزع فأتيت هذا الحائط فاحتفزت كما يحتفز الثعلب وهؤلاء الناس ورائي . فقال : [ يا أبا هريرة ] وأعطاني نعليه فقال : [ اذهب بنعلي هاتين فمن لقيت من وراء هذا الحائط يشهد أن لا إله إلا الله مستيقنا بها قلبه فبشره بالجنة ] وذكر الحديث بطوله . رواه مسلم(@)(@@) [ الربيع ] : النهر الصغير وهو الجدول - بفتح الجيم - كما فسره في الحديث(@)(@@) وقوله [ احتفزت ] روي بالراء وبالزاي . ومعناه بالزاي : تضاممت وتصاغرت حتى أمكنني الدخول(@)(@@) 710.

All of a sudden the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) got up and left us. When he was late to return to us we began to worry lest he should meet with trouble in our absence. I was the first to be alarmed and set out in search of him until I came to a garden belonging to Banu-Najjar (a section of the Ansar). I went round it looking for an entrance, but failed to find one. However, I saw a stream of water flowing into the garden from a well outside. I drew myself together like a fox and slinked into the place and reached the Messenger of Allah (PBUH). He said, "Is it Abu Hurairah?'' I replied in the affirmative. He asked, "What is the matter with you?'' I replied, "You were sitting with us and then you left us and delayed for a time. Fearing you had met with some adversities we got alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I squeezed myself like a fox and these people are coming behind me.'' He (the Prophet (PBUH)) gave me his sandals and said, "O Abu Hurairah! Take these sandals of mine, and whoever you meet outside this garden testifying that La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah), being assured of it in his heart, give him the glad tidings that he will enter Jannah.''

Ibn Shumasah reported: We visited `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was in his deathbed. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: "O father, did not the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) give you the good news of such and such? Did he not give you glad tidings of such and such?'' Then he (`Amr) turned his face towards us and said: "The best thing which you can count upon is the affirmation that: La ilaha illallah (there is no true god except Allah), and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. I have passed through three phases. I remember when I hated none more than I hated the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and there was no other desire stronger in me than that of killing him. Had I died in that state, I would have definitely been one of the dwellers of Fire (Hell). When Allah instilled the love for Islam in my heart, I went to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and said, `Extend your right hand, so that I pledge allegiance to you.' He (PBUH) stretched out his right hand, but I withdrew my hand. He said, `What is the matter, `Amr?' I said, `I wish to lay down same conditions.' He asked, `What conditions do you wish to put forward?' I replied, `To be granted forgiveness.' He said, `Do you not know that (embracing) Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). Verily, emigration wipes out all the previous sins, and the Hajj (pilgrimage) wipes out all the previous sins.' Thereafter, no one was dearer to me than Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and none was more respectable than him in my eyes. So bright was his splendour that I could not gather enough courage to look at his face for any length of time. If I were asked to describe his feature, I would not be able to do so because I have never caught a full glimpse of his face. Had I died in that state I could have hoped to be one of the dwellers of Jannah. Thereafter, we were made responsible for many things and in the light of which I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, no mourner, nor fire should accompany my bier. When you bury me, throw the earth gently over me and stand over my grave for the space of time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy, and in your presence ascertain what answer can I give to the Messengers of my Rubb (the angels in grave).''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith tells us about three phases of the life of `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with him), that is, pre-Islamic period, post-faith period and the governorship period. Of the last one, when he shouldered heavy responsibilities, he feared that he might have committed some lapses and for that he might be subjected to accountability before Allah. The Hadith invites our attention to the following points:(@)(@@) First, Amr's vehement hostility of pre-faith days was transformed into intense love for the Prophet (PBUH) upon embracing Islam. Second, the greatness of the Prophet (PBUH) was ingrained in the Companions' hearts. Third, the fear of error and the hope of Divine mercy may cause one to shed tears at the moment of death. Fourth, it is desirable on the part of relatives and friends to do something for the comfort of a dying person by giving him the glad tidings of Allah's Mercy. Fifth, Islam wipes out all previous sins, but afterwards, life should be led according to the dictates of true Faith. In the same way the minor sins are pardoned on account of Hijrah, and Hajj, but a sincere repentance with all its conditions is indispensable to the remission of major sins. Sixth, lamentation over a dead body is forbidden. Seventh, one may desirably make a will before death, particularly with regard to the anti-Shari`ah heresies and rites to which the bereaved people are likely to take recourse. Eighth, there is an affirmation of the orthodox belief that Munkir and Nakir (two angels) appear in the grave and question the dead person about his or her religious beliefs. Ninth, to stand over the grave and to pray for the salvation of the dead person is a desirable act, as the dead person enjoys the intimacy and the visit of the righteous to his grave. This Hadith, therefore, recommends believers to pray for the firmness of the dead person.(@)PageV01P897(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 96 - باب وداع الصاحب ووصيته عود فراقه لسفر وغيره والدعاء له وطلب الدعاء منه(@)(@@) Chapter 96(@)(@@) Bidding Farewell and Advising on the Eve of Departure for a Journey or other Things PageV01P898 قال الله تعالى ( البقرة 132 ، 133 ) : { ووصى بها إبراهيم بنيه ويعقوب : يا بني إن الله اصطفى لكم الدين فلا تموتن إلا وأنتم مسلمون أم كنتم شهداء إذ حضر يعقوب الموت إذ قال لبنيه ما

And let the supplicant specify the object.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim](@)(@@) Commentary: Literally Istikharah means seeking goodness from Allah through a particular prayer. This Hadith lays emphasis on it and displays its significance. We should, therefore, practise Istikharah regarding every important matter. However, it is imperative only in cases where one is ignorant of good and evil. Yet, with regard to obligatory and indisputable rules, practices of the Prophet (PBUH) and commendable deeds, no Istikharah is allowed. Similarly, commands and prohibitions of the Shari`ah are categorical and nobody is allowed to seek further guidance by performing Istikharah prayer. Moreover, to set aside the example of the Prophet (PBUH) of Istikharah, and to trust astrologers, palmists and soothsayers seeking the knowledge of future events is sheer ignorance and unpardonable error. The knowledge of the Unseen (or Ghaib) is the domain of Allah Alone and man is supposed to seek His Blessings. Only Allah is Omnipotent and humans must turn to Him to seek inspiration and strength, trusting everything to His Care.(@)(@@) Istikharah prayer can be offered at any time except in the forbidden hours for prayer because the performance of two Rak`ah is a prerequisite to it. Some people think that the right time for it is before going to bed. This is not true. This supplication (Du`a) can be offered even after performing the two Rak`ah of Istikharah prayer, or before Taslim (i.e., saying Assalamu `Alaikum to conclude the prayer) after Tashahhud or in the state of prostration. If somebody does not know this Du`a by heart, he can, after performing the prayer, read it from some prayerbook.(@)PageV01P908(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 98 - باب استحباب الذهاب إلى العيد وعيادة المريض والحج والغزو والجنازة ونحوها من طريق والرجوع من طريق آخر لتكثير مواضع العبادة(@)(@@) Chapter 98(@)(@@) Excellence of Adopting Different Routes for going and returning on 'Eid Prayer and various other Occasions(@)PageV01P909(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 719 - عن جابر رضي الله عنه قال : كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا كان يوم عيد خالف الطريق . رواه البخاري(@)(@@) قوله [ خالف الطريق ] : يعني ذهب في طريق ورجع في طريق آخر(@)(@@) 719.

All this is to be observed on the Sacrificial Day in the exact order of priorities. Yet, an unexpected disturbance in this order involves no juristic disadvantage. Moreover, the act of throwing pebbles marks an end to the ban on legal concessions. But this permissibility is minor and partial, that is, everything becomes lawful except the physical contact with one's wife. The ban is totally lifted in the wake of the farewell circumambulation of the House of Allah. Secondly, we are told that the ritual shaving of the head should begin from the right side.

Owing to Divine inspiration, he had seen the hidden hand of the Devil behind their abrupt actions. We have only one way to escape the Devil, that is, on such occasions we should first pronounce the Name of Allah. Second, this Hadith enlightens us on table manners calling for decency and decorum.

And if the situation is otherwise, the beginning should be made from the right side according to the Sunnah. Neither should the distributor give priority to himself nor to any elderly person from amongst the gathering.

The purity and beauty of this colour befits the dignity and honour of man.(@)PageV01P995(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 781 - وعن البراء رضي الله عنه قال : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم مربوعا ولقد رأيته في حلة حمراء ما رأيت شيئا قط أحسن منه . متفق عليه(@)(@@) 781. Bara' (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was of medium stature. I saw him wearing a red mantle. I have never seen anything more graceful than that.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: On the basis of this Hadith, some argue that red dress is also allowed to men. Imam An-Nawawi seems to hold the same view. However, many `Ulama' believe that the dress of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was not all red but had red stripes. They, therefore, maintain that the red clothes which women wear are not permissible to men. Some `Ulama' think that a ruling on this issue will be on condition of space and time. If at some place disbelievers or women are fond of this colour, it will be banned for Muslim men because of its relevance to disbelief and womanishness. Yet, it will be allowed to Muslim men in a contrary situation. Opinions also exist that the indoor wear of red clothes is permissible to men but forbidden in public. To sum up, the red-coloured dress is not itself a taboo with regard to men. A ruling on it will be conditional in accordance with the situation. For example, in the Eastern society the red-coloured dress is usually worn by women and is peculiar to brides on the occasion of wedding. Men are, therefore, banned to wear it. Allah Alone has the true knowledge.(@)PageV01P996(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 782 - وعن أبي جحيفة وهب بن عبد الله رضي الله عنه قال : رأيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بمكة وهو بالأبطح في قبة له حمراء من أدم فخرج بلال بوضوئه فمن ناضح ونائل فخرج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وعليه حلة حمراء كأني أنظر إلى بياض ساقيه فتوضأ وأذن بلال فجعلت أتتبع فاه ههنا وههنا يقول يمينا وشمالا : حي على الصلاة حي على الفلاح ثم ركزت له عنزة فتقدم فصلى يمر بين يديه الكلب والحمار لا يمنع . متفق عليه(@)(@@) [ العنزة ] بفتح النون : نحو العكازة(@)(@@) 782. Abu Juhaifah Wahb bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I saw the Prophet (PBUH) by Al-Abtah valley in Makkah, in a red tent made from tanned skin. Bilal brought him ablution water. Then Messenger of Allah (PBUH) came out wearing a red mantle; and I can still remember looking at whiteness of his shanks. So he made his ablution, and Bilal (PBUH) pronounced the call for prayer (Adhan). I kept following the movement of his (Bilal's) face to the right and to the left when he recited: `Come to the prayer; come to the success.' Then a spear was fixed (as a Sutrah) in front of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) who then stepped forward and led the prayer. Dogs and donkeys passed in front of him (beyond the spear) and no one prevented them from doing so.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: `Al-Abtah' is the name of a place which is also called the Muhassab valley. Lexically `Al-Abtah' means a sloping ground. Since it was the passage of rainy water owing to its downward slope, it came to be known by this name. Here the Prophet (PBUH) encamped in a tent.(@)(@@) This Hadith provides for wearing red-coloured clothes as mentioned in detail in the preceding Hadith. Second, it points out an issue concerning the ritual prayer. The worshipper should place something before him as a symbol of obstruction (Sutra) so that somebody who goes past him may not divert his attention. Yet, there is no harm if the passer is an animal.(@)PageV01P997(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 783 - وعن أبي رمثة رفاعة التيمي رضي الله عنه قال : رأيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وعليه ثوبان أخضران . رواه أبو داود والترمذي بإسناد صحيح(@)(@@) 783.
