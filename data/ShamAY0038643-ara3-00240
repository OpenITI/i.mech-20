Thirdly, the Prophet's example requires the pious persons to visit a bereaved family. Condoling them, they should invoke supplication and blessing for the departed soul. Besides, they should pray to Allah to bless the bereaved with both spiritual and material gains and multiple goodness. Supplication, as other Ahadith also tell us, is beneficial to the dead person. Condolence and supplication is undoubtedly a confirmed practice of the Prophet (PBUH). We are supposed to follow only what the Prophet (PBUH) did on such occasions, that is to say, to pray for both the departed soul and the bereaved family.

This is something natural and beyond human control. Rather the outflow of tears results from Divine compassion. This is neither forbidden nor subject to accountability. It is only wailing which is Haram, and is punishable. Yet, man is blessed with Divine mercy if he gives expression to patience and gratefulness by his tongue. Moreover, to mention the merits and excellence of a departed soul is in itself a good thing because others may be stimulated to adopt them. But to recount them by way of wailing is disliked. A Hadith says that a dead person is tormented because of the weeping of his household. Here weeping means lamenting and wailing. Otherwise, to weep is human instinct and no curbs can be put over it. Besides, this warning is meant for such a person who might have been accustomed to wailing during his lifetime. Or he might have left a will to his family for wailing over his death. May be he consciously avoided giving a predeath warning to his kith and kin against wailing. In all the three situations, he will be equally held accountable with his soul being tormented for the wailing of his relatives. In case, he is uninvolved in any of the situations, he will remain free from hellish torments. Instead the wailers will have to bear the brunt of their sin.

Thirdly, we are uncertain that after saying a funeral prayer, the Prophet pbuh and his Companions ever stood round the bier and supplicated for the dead body. It is an innovation (Bid`ah) and must be abolished. We are unauthorized to refer this practice to the Prophet (PBUH). It looks strange that believers should persist in reciting supplications in their own self-styled way after the funeral prayer, but desist from them during the funeral prayer to which they have relevance.

As the dimension of the world's impermanent nature and a heart- moving scene directly confront a man's eyes on this occasion, any moral exhortation is most likely to touch the heart. Secondly, the good or bad deeds of man during his fixed life span in this world prefigure in Allah's Knowledge, and He has ordained the good or bad end of everybody. But this does not mean that man is simply helpless in doing what Allah has predetermined. Indeed, Allah already knows that such and such a person will adopt the righteous conduct and meet a good end; and such and such a person will take to the mischievous way and consequently meet a bad end. Unless man has access to Allah's Knowledge and the Preserved Tablet (which is impossible), he is not supposed to give up the right conduct by banking upon His Knowledge. When he is totally ignorant of the Sacred Writ on his ultimate end, he has no other choice but to continue endeavouring in good pursuits. Allah has given him the freedom of choice and will subject him to accountability on this count alone. Moreover, it is the Divine principle that He helps everybody do only that type of work - facilitating it to him as well - which is germane to his bent of mind. Then, there is no reason that man should lag behind in embarking upon the virtuous path and not try to seek the Grace of Allah.(@)PageV01P1214(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 161 - باب الدعاء

For example, places like a hospital, a mosque, a religious school and a well built by a man continue to operate like a trust as traces of his activity in earthly life. To quote the Qur'an:(@)(@@) "And We record that which they send before (them), and their traces [their footsteps and walking on the earth with their legs to the mosques for the five compulsory congregational prayers, Jihad (holy fighting in Allah's Cause) and all other good and evil they did, and that which they leave behind].'' (36:12)(@)(@@) So long as they exist and people benefit from them, the dead person will keep receiving his due reward. The same is pertinent to the spread of knowledge of Islamic disciplines to people's moral uplift. For instance, if during his lifetime he wrote books based on Qur'an and Hadith, advocated the cause of Islam, instructed lots of pupils in Islamic teachings, it will be counted as an unending activity on his part. To quote a Hadath: "The one who called people to adopt the Right Path will receive reward in the same measure as did those who had the good fortune to follow him.'' Besides, this Hadith tells us that, after his death, man will receive reward by the prayers of his virtuous children, and other Ahadith too confirm it. This clears the issue of sending the fruit of good works to the welfare of a dead person's soul. Charity or the continual charity from the part of a dead person himself, beneficial (religious) knowledge and prayer are acts of Sunnah under this rule. With the exception of these, all other deeds do not benefit the dead. However, if the dead person was under obligation to perform Hajj or had missed obligatory or vowed fasts, his heirs are commanded by the Prophet (PBUH) to observe them on his behalf. Because this is like a debt payable by the dead person and his heirs are under obligation to discharge it for him.

Indeed, a believer never utters anything out of malice or self-conceit. There are some Ahadith which forbid us to speak ill of dead people. This rule applies to the true believers only. The Shari`ah argument is against it. However, we are allowed to talk about the misdeeds of the infidels and people who commit sins openly, disregarding the Shari`ah so that others may abstain from imitating a bad example.(@)PageV01P1223(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 951 - وعن أبي الأسود قال : قدمت المدينة فجلست إلى عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه فمرت بهم جنازة فأثني على صاحبها خيرا فقال عمر رضي الله عنه : وجبت . ثم مر بأخرى فأثني على صاحبها خيرا فقال عمر : وجبت . ثم مر

Islam, on the contrary, has given us a positive, simple and man-orientated formula of mutual cooperation. It teaches us that what can be spared should be given to those who need it. This obviates the chances of hoarding as well as the concentration of wealth in a few hands. No doubt, it is a moral instruction. But if Muslims, called as a single body, develop a true sense and awareness of it, wonderful results can accrue from it on a large social scale. What is more, the sublimity of man's Faith and moral behaviour stands on it. One who is indifferent to the perfection of Faith and morality may set it aside.

The Prophet (PBUH) held that As-Sab` Al-Mathani is Surat Al-Fatihah (the Opening Chapter) because these seven Ayat are recited not only in every Salat but in every Rak`ah of every Salat for the reason that no Salat is valid without the recitation of this Surah, as is evident from the saying of the Prophet (PBUH): "The Salat of that person who has not recited Surat Al-Fatihah is void.''

At some places, however, it has also been narrated in the present tense.(@)PageV01P1314(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1017 - وعن أبي مسعود البدري رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ من قرأ بالآيتين من آخر سورة البقرة في ليلة كفتاه ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) قيل : كفتاه المكروه تلك الليلة . وقيل : كفتاه عن قيام الليل(@)(@@) 1017. Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (PBUH) saying, "He who recites the two Ayat at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: "Suffice him'' here means that he will be protected from the evils. Its another meaning is that these two Ayat will take the place of Tahajjud (optional prayer in the late hours of the night). Imam An-Nawawi has cited the latter meaning.(@)PageV01P1315(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1018 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ لا تجعلوا بيوتكم مقابر إن الشيطان ينفر من البيت الذي تقرأ فيه سورة البقرة ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 1018. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) saying: "Do not turn your houses into graveyards. Satan runs away from the house in which Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith instructs us not to turn our homes into the like of a graveyard through the negligence of reciting the Qur'an in them. It also points out the excellence of Surat Al-Baqarah, which when recited, will certainly keep the devil away.(@)PageV01P1316(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1019 - وعن أبي بن كعب رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ يا أبا المنذر أتدري أي آية من كتاب الله معك أعظم ؟ قلت : { الله لا إله إلا هو الحي القيوم } فضرب في صدري وقال : [ ليهنك العلم أبا المنذر ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 1019. Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "Abu Mundhir! Do you know which Ayah in Allah's Book is the greatest?'' I replied: "It is `Allah la ilaha illa Huwal-Haiyul-Qayum (Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living...)'.'' (2:256) Thereupon he (PBUH) patted me in the chest and said, "Rejoice by this knowledge, O Abu Mundhir!''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: The words cited in the Hadith occur at the beginning of Ayat-ul-Kursi (No. 256 of Surat Al-Baqarah of the Qur'an). The merits mentioned in the Hadith are for the whole Ayah. Ayat-ul-Kursi mentions the Majestic Attributes and Mighty Powers of Allah and is, therefore, very meritorious.(@)(@@) "Rejoice by this knowledge'' means "May this knowledge be a source of respect, honour and benefit to you.'' And knowledge here stands for the knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith which is certainly a means of success in this world and the Hereafter.(@)PageV01P1317(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1020 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي
