I found that (this man who was) Messenger of Allah (PBUH) remained hidden because of the persecution by his people. I had entered Makkah stealthily and when I met him I asked him, "Who are you?'' He (PBUH) said, "I am a Prophet.'' I asked; "What is a Prophet?'' He said, "Allah has sent me (with a message)". I asked, "With what has He sent you?''

He said, "A freeman and a slave". (At that time only Abu Bakr and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with her) were with him). I said, "I shall follow you". He said, "You can not do that now. Do you not see my situation and that of the people? Go to your people, and when you hear that my cause has prevailed, come to me". So I went back to my people, and while I was with my people, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) emigrated to Al-Madinah. I continued to ask people about him till some of my people visited Al-Madinah. On their return, I asked them, "How is that man who has arrived in Al-Madinah faring?'' They said, "People are hastening to him. His own people had planned to kill him but did not succeed.'' Then I went to Al-Madinah and came to him and said, "O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?'' He (PBUH) said, "Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.'' I said, "O Messenger of Allah, tell me of that which Allah has taught you and of which I am unaware. Tell me about Salat first.'' He (PBUH) replied, "Perform the Fajr (morning) Salat, then stop Salat until the sun has risen up to the height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises up between the horns of the devil, and the infidels prostrate themselves before it at that time. Then perform Salat, for Salat is witnessed and angels attend it, until the shadow becomes equal to the length of its object; then stop Salat, for at that time Jahannam (Hell) is heated up. Then pray when the shadow becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and angels attend it, until you perform `Asr prayer; then stop Salat till sun sets, for it sets between the horns of a devil. At that time the infidels prostrate themselves before it.''

Then when he washes his face as commanded by Allah, the sins of his face are washed out with the water from the sides of his beard. Then when he washes his hands up to elbows, the sins of his hands are washed out through his fingers with water.

The remedy is that one should look at the people who have lesser worldly goods and riches than one's own. If a person has a small house of his own which can protect him from the harshness of weather, then he has no need to see enviously towards sky-high buildings and palatial houses of others. He should look at the homeless people who spend their nights on footpaths and live in huts which in rain leak like sieve and are swept away by a wave of flood water, etc. But from a religious angle, one should see towards those who are more fearful of Allah and observe their Salat meticulously so that one becomes more fond of obedience of Allah, has a greater fear of Him and devotes more time to prayer and devotion.

What it really means is that one should be contented with what he possess and rid himself of greed. Islam neither permits renunciation of the world nor does it condemn genuine struggle to acquire wealth and riches. Therefore, involvement in worldly affairs and struggle for lawful means of livelihood are not against Zuhd. A person who is contented with the lawful means of income is a distinguished person as all his activities are exalted to the level of worship. Similarly, unconcern with the wealth and riches of others and ignoring them is a part of Zuhd and contentment. One additional advantage of it is that such a person wins the love and respect of the people because he who begs people, rather than Allah, has to suffer disgrace and is disliked by the people. The case of begging from Allah is just the opposite. The more a person begs Him, the more pleased He will be with him. In fact, He is displeased if someone does not beg Him.

Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: By Allah other than Whom there is none worthy of worship, I used to press my stomach against the earth owing to my hunger; I would tie a stone over it. One day, I was sitting on the way they usually take when the Prophet (PBUH) passed by me. When he saw me he smiled at me and knew my condition and my feelings. He called me and I replied, "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Follow me.'' So I followed him. Having arrived at home, he sought permission and entered. He allowed me in and I, too, entered. He found milk in a bowl and asked, "Where is this from?'' He was told that it was a gift for him from so-and-so. He called me and I responded: "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Go to the people of As-Suffah and usher them in.'' He Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) explained: The people of As-Suffah were guests of Islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. When Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to receive something in charity, he would send it to them without taking anything from it. When he received a present, he would send for them and share it with them. On this occasion, I disliked to give them anything. I said to myself: "This meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of As- Suffah! I am more deserving of it than anyone else. By drinking it I may attain some strength. When they come, he will order me to give it to them. I do not expect that anything will be left for me from this milk.'' As there was no alternative but to obey Allah and His Messenger (PBUH). I went and called them. They came and sought permission which was granted. They took their seats. The Prophet (PBUH) called me and I responded, "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He then said, "Take the milk and give it to them.'' I took the bowl and gave it to one man who drank his fill and returned it to me, and I gave it to the next and he did the same. I went on doing this till the bowl reached Messenger of Allah (PBUH). By that time all had taken their fill. He (PBUH) took the bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said, "Abu Hirr.'' I said, "At your service, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Now you and I are left.'' I said, "That is true, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said, "Sit down and drink.'' I drank, but he went on saying, "Drink some more.'' I said, "By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have no room for it.'' He said, "Then give it to me.'' So I gave him the bowl. He praised Allah, uttered the Name of Allah and drank the remainder.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: First, this Hadith indicates the miracle of the Prophet (PBUH) as well as his love and compassion for Ahlus-Suffah, i.e., those poor people who used to stay at As-Suffah. Second, the Prophet (PBUH) would not accept charity, but only gifts. Third, he would also let others share a gift given to him by somebody. Fourth, as seen in this incident, the leftovers of a Muslim, whether food or drink, is permissible to others to consume. Fifth, to persuade a guest to eat or drink more is commendable.
