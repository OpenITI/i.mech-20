It is very difficult indeed to rise for Salat-ul-Fajr (the dawn prayer). Similar is the case of Salat-ul-`Asr (the afternoon prayer). It is the time when a person is very busy in winding up his daily affairs and thus there is serious risk of losing this Salat on this account. One who observes these two at their stated time, can easily secure the other three without much effort. This endeavour on his part to secure Salat will be a very effective means for him to enter Jannah.(@)PageV01P160(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 133 - السابع عشر عنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ إذا مرض العبد أو سافر كتب له مثل ما كان يعمل مقيما صحيحا ] رواه البخاري(@)(@@) 133.

Have I not been informed that you observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.'' I replied, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah!'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Don't do that. Observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you; your visitors have a right upon you. It is sufficient for you to observe fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.'' I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction. I said, "O Messenger of Allah! I have strength.'' Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Observe fast like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (PBUH); and do not fast more than that.'' I said: "How was the fasting of Prophet Dawud?'' He (PBUH) said, "Half of the year (i.e., he used to fast on every alternate day).''(@)(@@) Afterwards when `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) grew old, he used to say: "Would that I had availed myself of the concession granted to me by Messenger of Allah.''(@)(@@) In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "I have been informed that you observe fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur'an) every night.'' I said, "Messenger of Allah! It is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good,'' whereupon he (PBUH) said, "Then observe fasts like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (PBUH) as he was the most ardent worshipper of Allah; recite the Qur'an once every month.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of doing more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it (the complete Qur'an) in every twenty days.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah I am capable of reciting more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it once in every ten days.'' I said, "O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of reciting more than that.'' He said, "Then recite it once in every seven days, but not recite more than that.'' The Prophet of Allah also said to me, "You do not know, you may have a longer life". When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted to me by) the Prophet of Allah.(@)(@@) In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "The best fasting with Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud, and the best prayer with Allah is that of Dawud (PBUH) for he would sleep half of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it and (then) would sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and leave off the other. He would not flee on meeting the enemy".(@)(@@) In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: My father helped me marry a noble woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in- law regarding her husband. She would say: "He is, indeed, a fine man. Since I have come to him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has had sexual intercourse with me". When this state of affairs lasted for some time, my father mentioned the matter to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) who directed my father saying, "Send him to me". I went to him accordingly. He asked me, "How often do you observe fast?'' I replied; "Daily". He asked me, "How long do you take in reading the Noble Qur'an completely.'' I said, "Once every night". Then he narrated the whole story. He (in his old age) would recite one seventh of his nightly recitation to some members of his family during the day to lighten his task at night. Whenever he wished to have a relief from his fast on alternate days, he would give up fasting for a few days and make up deficiency later by observing the number of fasts he had missed. He would not give up the number of fasts altogether because he did not like to abandon what he had settled with Messenger of Allah (PBUH).(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith brings the following two things into focus:(@)(@@) 1.

Another part, which is solid, held the water and Allah benefits men thereby, who drank and gave others to drink, and used it for irrigation.

A person who neither learns it nor acts upon it is like a desolate land which neither holds water nor produces anything. Such a person is the worst of all because he neither himself benefits from it nor lets others make use of it.

Then he went into his house and came out; then he commanded Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) to proclaim Adhan (call to prayers).

Every society has many able-bodied young people who want to take part in Jihad but do not have the resources for it, and this is how a very useful segment of the society fails to make any contribution to it. On the other hand, there are people in the society who have plenty of resources but do not possess health, vigour and youth which are essential for Jihad. According to the method prescribed in this Hadith, not only the requisite manpower and resources essential for Jihad are combined but everyone gets an even share in its reward. It should be kept in mind that in the early period of Islam, Mujahidun (the Muslims who took part in Jihad) were neither professional soldiers nor were they paid regular salaries, the way they now constitute a regular, permanent and vast military institution. These Mujahidun used to take part in Jihad voluntarily as is being done nowadays under many organizations also.(@)PageV01P221(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 178 - وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بعث بعثا إلى بني لحيان من هذيل فقال : [ لينبعث من كل رجلين أحدهما والأجر بينهما ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 178.

The goodwill of the Muslim rulers stands here for co-operating with them in their lawful orders and obedience of their such orders which are free from any trace of sin. If they deviate from the Straight Path they should be persuaded to turn to virtue. One should not revolt against them unless they commit infidelity.
