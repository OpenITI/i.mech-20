That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from the Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do.

Thus, what it implies is that Muslim Ummah is not responsible for the enforcement of Islamic Shari`ah in the world and all it is concerned with is its own improvement only. By narrating this Hadith, Abu Bakr As- Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) refuted this interpretation of the Ayah and made it clear that it is the duty of the Ummah and each of its member to make best possible efforts to check the vices prevalent in the society. So much so that if a Muslim has the ability to check the vices by means of force or speech but he does not do it, his negligence in this regard will become a cause of Divine wrath and punishment. The true significance of this ayah is that if, in spite of the best efforts on the part of the pious ones there is no improvement, and people do not abstain from sins and disobedience of Allah, then the pious persons will not be held responsible for what the defaulters do, nor would they suffer on this account.

I expect that I shall be the the wronged one today. I am much worried about my debt. Do you think that anything will be left over from our property after the payment of my debt?

By Allah, I did not understand what he meant and asked: "Father, who is your Master?'' He said: "Allah.'' By Allah! Whenever I faced a difficulty in discharging any portion of his debt; I would pray: "O Master of Zubair, discharge his debt,'' and He discharged it. Zubair was martyred. He left no money, but he left certain lands, one of them in Al-Ghabah, eleven houses in Al-Madinah, two in Basrah, one in Kufah and one in Egypt. The cause of his indebtedness was that a person would come to him asking him to keep some money of his in trust for him. Zubair would refuse to accept it as a trust, fearing it might be lost, but would take it as a loan. He never accepted a governorship, or revenue office, or any public office. He fought along with Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with them).(@)(@@) `Abdullah added: I prepared a statement of his debts and they amounted to two million and two hundred thousand!

Thus he sold the land and discharged his father's debt. There remained out of the land four and a half shares. He then visited Mu`awiyah who had with him at the time `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam`ah (May Allah bepleased with them). Mu`awiyah (May Allah bepleased with him) said: "What price did you put on the land in Al-Ghabah?'' He said: "One hundred thousand for a each share.

He made this declaration on four Hajj seasons and then distributed the inheritance among the heirs of Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) according to his will.

Such people who believe that no Hadd punishment is fixed for drinking take support from this Hadith. They hold that its punishment is discretionary which can be increased or decreased according to the circumstances. But other learned men who hold that its Hadd is forty stripes argue that the incident quoted in this Hadith relates to the period when its Hadd had not been fixed. When the Prophet (PBUH) ordered the punishment of forty stripes for it then it became its prescribed Hadd. Abu Bakr (May Allah bepleased with him) followed it during the period of his caliphate. `Umar (May Allah bepleased with him) also applied it in the early years of his caliphate but subsequently raised its punishment to eighty stripes. The `Ulama' who maintain the punishment of forty stripes contend that the original Hadd was forty stripes and the additional forty stripes comprised discretionary punishment for which the Head of a state has full authority. If he feels, he can add discretionary punishment to the Hadd. The nature of this additional punishment depends on his discretion. The latter opinion seems to be more correct that Hadd is fixed for drinking and its punishment is not based on discretion.

That man replied: "He is one of the noblest men. By Allah he is certainly a proper person for (a girl) being given in marriage if he seeks to marry, and his recommendation is fit to be accepted if he recommends". Messenger of Allah (PBUH) remained silent. Then another man passed. Messenger of Allah (PBUH) enquired, "What is your opinion about this man?'' He replied: "O Messenger of Allah, he is one of the poor Muslims. He is not a proper person (for a girl) to be given in marriage to, and his recommendation would not be accepted if he makes one; if he speaks, he is not to be listened to.''

The distinction and greatness of such poor Muslims who are neither known in society because due to their poverty nor are they respected by people.

Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), the second one was the companion of Juraij who was a pious person. Juraij took a secluded monastery for worship and confined himself in it. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she called: `Juraij.' He said: `My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer.' He continued with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was (still) busy in prayer. She called: `Juraij.' And he said: `My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer,' and she returned. Then on the next day she again came while he was busy in prayer and called: `Juraij.' And he said: `My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in my prayer.' And he continued with the prayer. She said: `My Rubb, don't let him die until he has seen the faces of the prostitutes.' The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer spread amongst Banu Israel. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty personified. She said (to the people): `If you like, I can lure him to evil.' She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him. He (the shepherd) had sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant. When she gave birth to a baby she said: `This is from Juraij.' So they came and asked Juraij to get down and demolished the temple and began to beat him. He asked them what the matter was. They said: `You have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a baby from you.' He said: `Where is the baby?' They brought him (the baby) and then he said: `Just leave me so that I should perform prayer.' He performed prayer and when he finished, he lifted the baby in his stomach and asked him: `O boy, who is your father?' The baby answered: `He is such and such a shepherd.' So, the people turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking blessing) and said: `We are prepared to construct your temple with gold.' He said, `No just, rebuild it with mud as it had been,' and so they did". (The Prophet (PBUH) continued:) "Then there was a baby who was sucking at his mother's breast when a person dressed in fine garment came on a priceless riding animal's back. His mother said: `O Allah, make my child like this one.' He (the babe) left sucking and looked at him, and said: `O Allah, don't make me like him.' He then returned to the breast and resumed sucking.'' He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: As though I can see Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as he is illustrating the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)) further reported Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as saying, "There happened to pass by them a slave girl who was being beaten and they were saying: `You have committed fornication and theft.' She was saying: `Allah is enough for me and He is my Good Protector, and his mother said: `O Allah, don't make my child like her.' He left sucking looked at her and said: `O Allah! Make me like her.' It was followed by a conversation between the mother and the child. She said: `A good looking man happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and there passed a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and theft, and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her.' The child said: `That man was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah don't make me like him; and they were saying about the girl: You committed fornication, whereas in fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft, whereas she had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her".(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith tells us of three babies who spoke in the cradle.
