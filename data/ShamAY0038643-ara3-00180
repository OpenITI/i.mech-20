It is not necessary that they should hear it and also respond to it. Allah has the power to make them hear it, too. But ours should not be the belief that the dead do hear and reply.

All that is bad and vicious is considered by Islam as sinful. This Hadith describes two signs of a sin. First, man should feel scruples in committing it. Second, one does not like others being informed about it.

But it is so about financial matters and Hudud (punishments) and Qisas (retaliation in punishment). For example, regarding the first, the Qur'an says that the evidence of two women is equal to that of one man. Similarly, the `Ulama' have not trusted the evidence of a woman about matters concerning Hudud and Qisas, rather they have considered in this connection, the evidence of man indispensable. However, they are all unanimous in accepting the evidence of even a single woman in matters of which men are uninformed. These, for instance, include the problems of a child's birth and its legitimacy and the weak points of women. And the argument is supported by this Hadith. When the woman gave evidence that she had suckled both the husband and the wife and was the foster-mother of the two, they separated from each other.

To eat the fallen morsel after cleaning it and to lick up the dish shows, apart from humbleness, regard for the Divine gift. Such an act pleases Allah. In it there is another advantageous aspect. Man never knows which is the blessed portion of food. When one licks up the dish, or even his fingers, picks up the fallen morsel and eats it after cleaning it, nothing will be wasted from the meal. In this way, the blessed portion of meal will automatically come to him and he will not remain deprived of it. Moreover, the Hadith tells us that Allah's Blessing, in whatever small quantity it may be, must not be wasted. Yet unfortunately, as we see today, food is wasted like anything in the feasts and marriage ceremonies.

Sa`b bin Jaththamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I presented a wild ass to Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as a gift but he returned it to me. When he perceived signs of despair on my face, he said, "I have declined to accept it because I am in the state of Ihram.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: As, in the state of Ihram, hunting is not allowed to a pilgrim; similarly, the meat of the game, killed on his suggestion or instruction, is forbidden to him, too. For this reason, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent back the gift of the wild ass to his Companion. The Hadith further illustrates that if the recipient has any valid excuse for not accepting a gift, he should explain it so that the sender may not feel dejected. It may be mentioned here that some Ahadith allow us to eat the meat of a game killed by others, whereas this Hadith shows it is not permissible. The orthodox `Ulama', however, have attempted to reconcile the two seemingly incompatible sets of Ahadith with each other. According to the first category of Ahadith, a man, not in the state of Ihram who kills a chase and gives a portion of it as a gift to someone who is in Ihram, the gift will be permissible to the latter. As for the second category of Ahadith, the former kills a game for the latter, or on his suggestion, the man in the state of Ihram will be barred from eating it (as mentioned in Fath Al-Bari). Similarly, it will not be lawful if the game is sent alive to the man in the state of Ihram with this intention that he should himself sacrifice it. The Hadith under discussion depicts this very situation. Imam Bukhari, as we know, has consequently adduced from this Hadith that if an unkilled game, like the wild donkey, is sent as a gift to a man in the state of Ihram, he should not accept it(@)PageV01P768(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 624 - وعن النواس بن سمعان رضي الله عنه قال : سألت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عن البر والإثم . فقال : [ البر حسن الخلق . والإثم ما حاك في صدرك وكرهت أن يطلع عليه الناس ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 624.

Also, a simple and understandable principle is laid down about sin. Man feels the pricking of conscience over every bad deed and is also afraid of the reproach of fault-finders, provided he has not reached the lowest point of moral depravity. But a seared conscience is least disturbed even by a heinous and deadly sin or by public censure. We can understand it by the example of man's smelling sense. If it is not dead, man can feel a stink and repugnant odour.

Fear of Allah really links up a man to Him, and moral refinement prevents him from falling short of his duties to people. To be sure, adherence to this two-fold practice will cause the entry of a lot of people to Jannah. Many a man, on the other hand, has a long, sharp and dangerous tongue and this causes him to pour out heretic utterances and indulge in backbiting, slandering and abusive and nonsensical talk. All this activity leads to Hell. As for genitals, an unwary and unrestrained attitude incites one to indulge in immoral pursuits. In both these cases countless people will be led into Hell. For this reason it is imperative for everybody to develop Taqwa (consciousness of Allah / fear of Allah ) and refined behaviour and shun the wickedness of tongue and genitals so that his life in the Hereafter may not be ruined.(@)PageV01P772(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 628 - وعنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ أكمل المؤمنين إيمانا أحسنهم خلقا وخياركم خياركم لنسائهم ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن صحيح(@)(@@) 628.

Yet, Allah disapproves of even the harmless or trivial form of falsehood and commands His slaves to keep away from it. From all considerations, however, moral excellence carries immense weight.

All these situations warrant killing but with a stress on moderation, thanks to Islamic teachings. A believer is told not to let his passions of enmity go wild, and even an enemy or a criminal ought not to be put to a torturous death. In the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance it was a prevalent practice that the limbs of a victim were mutilated before he was finally killed. Islam has forcefully forbidden this inhuman custom, stating that the victim should be beheaded with the one swing of sword. Similarly, there are specific instructions regarding an animal's slaughter. First, the knife should be sharpened. Second, the animal must not be slaughtered from its nape, because in both ways it will suffer pain. This Shari`ah rule ensures quick death of the animal. In modern Europe, an animal is slaughtered with one stroke of a cutting- machine. Apparently this method seems to be easy and smooth, yet in this way the animal's blood doesn't flow out from its body completely. So the consumption of the meat of such a kill is injurious to human health. Due to this reason, Islam considers the discharge of blood as a prerequisite to Halal (lawful). Certainly, only the Islamic way of slaughtering an animal is more sound, scientific and wholesome.(@)PageV01P787(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 641 - وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت : ما خير رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بين أمرين قط إلا أخذ أيسرهما ما لم يكن إثما فإن كان إثما كان أبعد الناس منه وما انتقم رسول

For instance, if he were asked to award one of the two punishments to somebody, he would choose the milder one. And if he had the liberty of choice between two obligations, he would opt for the easier one. Between war and peace he would always go for peace, provided it involved the interest of Islam and Muslims. Moreover, in all matters he used to take the line of least resistance, in case it went without the disobedience of Allah. In this Hadith, a principle has been defined for Muslims in general as well that they are free to take to an easy way but this must not entail a loophole in respect of the Shari`ah. Secondly, the most excellent character of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) also comes to our view that he never retaliated for personal reasons. His extraordinary concern for the sanctity of Islamic Law is also displayed by the fact that he could never brook the transgression of Allah's limits, and the transgressor was sure to be punished by him. The Prophet's attitude also explains and delimits the sphere of morality that to let the violator of Divine law go scot-free must not be counted as a sign of good manners. Rather it reflects the lack of religious sensibility. Not to take exception to lapses in mundane affairs surely speaks of moral excellence, but we are not allowed to dispense with the evasion of religious rules.(@)PageV01P788(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 642 - وعن ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ ألا أخبركم بمن يحرم على النار أو بمن تحرم عليه النار ؟ تحرم على كل قريب هين لين سهل ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن(@)(@@) 642.

So I departed with deep distress. I did not recover until I arrived at Qarn ath-Tha`alib. There, I raised my head and saw a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I saw in it Jibril (Gabriel) (PBUH) who called me and said: `Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, heard what your people said to you and the response they made to you. And He has sent you the angel in charge of the mountains to order him to do to them what you wish.' Then the angel of the mountains called me, greeted me and said: `O Muhammad, Allah listened to what your people had said to you. I am the angel of the mountains, and my Rubb has sent me to you so that you may give me your orders. (I will carry out your orders). If you wish I will bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Makkah to crush them in between.''' But Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "I rather hope that Allah will raise from among their descendants people as will worship Allah the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him (in worship).''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: In the vicinity of Al-Madinah stands a mountain, called Uhud, where the `Battle of Uhud' took place. It was in this battle that the Prophet's face was wounded, one of his molars was broken and he fell into a pit dug by `Amr Ar-Rahib. Besides, his uncle, Hamzah (May Allah be pleased with him) was martyred and the disbelievers mutilated his body. `Aqabah was a place at Ta'if where Messenger of Allah (PBUH) rode up from Makkah and met the worst experience. Or, it could be that the incident occurred somewhere at Mina where, during the Hajj season, he urged the different clans to accept the message of Islam so as to seek their help to establish the true religion. Qarn Ath-Tha`alib is also the name of a place which is the Miqat (transit-point where pilgrims assume the state of Ihram) of the Najd people.(@)(@@) This Hadith also reflects the marvellous character of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) that he never rebuked the ignorant and those who caused him harm, nor did he ever avenge anybody on grounds of personal hostility. Secondly, he would endure all forms of hardships in the way of Allah with patience and endurance. He never became furious over his harassers, rather he prayed for their guidance. No doubt, the Prophetic life- pattern perennially provides inspiration to preachers and religious instructors. The responsibility of preaching is not a bed of roses but a thorny path to tread on. It is not the welcome and applause which is meted out to him, but people's taunts, reproaches and insults are heaped on the preacher. Consequently, patience, self-possession, self-control and tolerance are vital to braving trials and tribulations in the way of Allah.(@)PageV01P792(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 644 - وعنها رضي الله عنها قالت : ما ضرب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم شيئا قط بيده ولا امرأة ولا خادما إلا أن يجاهد في سبيل الله وما

The rule equally applies to a hand-made picture and a camera photograph, provided it is that of an animate object. Yet, making or keeping pictures of inanimate objects, both of mineral and vegetable kingdoms, is permissible. However, one is at liberty to get oneself photographed in an unavoidable situation. For instance, photographs are indispensable to passports, identity cards and similar other necessities of modern times in which man is helpless and we can not assert that he is inclined to satisfy his taste or to get himself photographed as a token of permissibility.

Some said Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) was his beloved and so he may dare do so. So Usamah(May Allah be pleased with him) spoke to him about that matter and the Prophet (PBUH) said to him, "Do you intercede when one of the legal punishments ordained by Allah has been voilated?''

Later would emerge, it was prophesized, mischief after mischief, each being worse than the preceding one. Today, everybody sees the truth of this prophecy like the light of day. By predicting the emergence of mischief, Messenger of Allah (PBUH) wanted to warn his followers that they should keep themselves aloof from them. To them he further explained in advance the precautionary measures, that is, to keep faith in Allah, to remain firm-footed in the belief in the Hereafter and to deal with people fairly, attempting to be polite to them at the same time.(@)(@@) Besides, prophecy has been made about the abundance of the power- hungry people with a remedial note. In the first instance believers are supposed to swear allegiance to the caliph, and by extending their cooperation to him they should kill another claimant to the caliphate because it is only in this way that the unity of the Muslim Ummah can be maintained, free of chaos and discord. Yet, unfortunately, the power- orientated groups have found a plaything in the shape of democracy, turning peace and unity into a legend of the past. What a pity that despite all that they seek stability and progress! Is it the miracle of time or the quirk of the vested interests that has reversed the whole scheme of things?

True, one cannot take the law into one's own hands, yet there always remains room for improvement and positive criticism.

A government should primarily aim at the welfare of people and not serve the interests of the privileged few or benefit the holders of key posts alone.(@)PageV01P844(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) | AUTO 1- كتاب الأدب(@)(@@) Book One: The Book of Good Manners(@)PageV01P845(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 84 - باب الحياء وفضله والحث على التخلق به(@)(@@) Chapter 84(@)(@@) Exaltation of Modesty(@)PageV01P846(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 681 - عن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم مر على رجل من الأنصار وهو يعظ أخاه في الحياء . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ دعه فإن الحياء من الإيمان ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 681.

Such a man is never sharp in worldly affairs because modesty restrains him from following wrong ways. For this reason, modesty has been called a part of the faith. This is an inborn quality, that is, some people are unassertive by birth. Yet, if they are gradually guided and directed towards virtues, their unassumingness further increases. And in Islam it is counted a virtue.(@)PageV01P847(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 682 - وعن عمران بن حصين رضي الله عنهما قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ الحياء لا يأتي إلا بخير ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) وفي رواية لمسلم : [ الحياء خير كله ] أو قال : [ الحياء كله خير ](@)(@@) 682. `Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Shyness does not bring anything except good.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) In a narration of Muslim: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "All of shyness is good.''(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith enlightens us on the excellence of modesty, which serves the good purpose of preventing man from the disobedience of Allah and from immoral and evil pursuits. Evidently, it has a salutary impact on society. Besides, it keeps man free from sins, and, consequently, he will stand blameless with Allah. From this standpoint, modesty is certainly a thorough good.(@)PageV01P848(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 683 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ الإيمان بضع وسبعون أو بضع وستون شعبة . فأفضلها قول لا إله إلا الله وأدناها إماطة الأذى عن الطريق . والحياء شعبة من الإيمان ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) [ البضع ] بكسر الباء ويجوز فتحها وهو : من الثلاثة إلى العشرة(@)(@@) و[ الشعبة ] : القطعة والخصلة(@)(@@) و[ الإماطة ] : الإزالة(@)(@@) و[ الأذى ] : ما يؤذي كحجر وشوك وطين ورماد وقذر ونحو ذلك(@)(@@) 683.

Here it has been repeated with reference to the degrees of Faith. Modesty, too, is a part of Faith, rather one of its most important ingredients, because it plays an effective role in the training and sublimation of human psyche.(@)PageV01P849(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 684 - وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه قال : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أشد حياء من العذراء في خدرها فإذا رأى شيئا يكرهه عرفناه في وجهه . متفق عليه(@)(@@) قال العلماء : حقيقة الحياء : خلق يبعث على ترك القبيح ويمنع من التقصير في حق ذي الحق(@)(@@) وروينا عن أبي القاسم الجنيد رحمه الله قال : الحياء رؤية الآلاء : أي النعم ورؤية التقصير فيتولد بينهما حالة تسمى حياء والله أعلم(@)(@@) 684.

An unmarried woman, above all else, is considered to be the embodiment of bashfulness. Islamic countries have witnessed many curses of western civilization and the worst is the one which has robbed away the modesty of woman because it is the last protective shield of Islamic civilization which the enemy is consistently sweeping off.

Indeed, the sanctity of conjugal rights contributes to the consolidation of moral norms and social cohesion. Yet, what passes between wife and husband on the consummation night is usually taken in a light vein in our societies. In the morning, both of them relate their sexual experience to their friends respectively. This is moral indecency which is incompatible with human dignity and civilized behaviour. This Hadith reckons it as a grave sin which must be eschewed. The bed-experience must be kept private by the married couple to the exclusion of a third person.(@)PageV01P853(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 686 - وعن

I waited for a few days and then `Uthman met me and said: "It occurred to me that I should not marry at present.'' Then I met Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: "If you are willing, I shall marry my daughter Hafsah to you.'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) remained silent and did not utter any word to me in reply. I grew more angry with him than with `Uthman. I had waited for only a few days when Messenger of Allah (PBUH) asked for her hand in marriage and I married her to him. Thereafter, I met Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) who said, "Perhaps you were angry with me when you offered Hafsah to me and I said nothing in reply.'' I said, "Yes, that is so.'' He said, "Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Messenger of Allah (PBUH) had mentioned her and I could not disclose the secret of Messenger of Allah (PBUH). Had Messenger of Allah (PBUH) left her, I would have accepted her.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: To keep a secret and not to disclose it to people is the theme of this chapter as reflected in this Hadith. The Hadith has also other points which invite our attention. Firstly, a man can offer his daughter's hand to a righteous person. Secondly, it is undesirable for parents to send a message to another party for the wedlock of their daughter when talks with someone else are already continuing in this regard. Thirdly, if Messenger of Allah (PBUH) wanted to marry a woman but could not realize his intention for a reason or another, it was permissible for a Muslim to marry her because, juristically speaking, such a woman could not be counted as the Prophet's wife.(@)PageV01P854(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 687 - وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت : كن أزواج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عنده فأقبلت فاطمة رضي الله عنها تمشي ما تخطئ مشيتها من مشية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم شيئا فلما رآها رحب بها وقال : [ مرحبا بابنتي ] ثم أجلسها عن يمينه أو عن شماله ثم سارها فبكت بكاء شديدا فلما رأى جزعها سارها الثانية فضحكت . فقلت لها : خصك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من بين نسائه بالسرار ثم أنت تبكين ؟ فلما قام رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم سألتها : ما قال لك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ؟ قالت : ما كنت لأفشي على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم سره . فلما توفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلت : عزمت عليك بما لي عليك من الحق لما حدثتني ما قال لك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ؟ فقالت : أما الآن فنعم : أما حين سارني في المرة
