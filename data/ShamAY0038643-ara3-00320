This is the reason that in Arabic it applies to both, masculine as well as feminine. Man is the Zauj of woman and woman is the Zauj of a man. In any case, here it means the Prophet's wives who are eleven in number. Two of them had died during the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH) and nine survived after him. Islam does not permit more than four wives to a Muslim but the Prophet (PBUH) was given the exclusive permission for numerous considerations which have been discussed by religious scholars at length.(@)(@@) This Hadith also refutes the opinion of those who do not include his pious wives in the category of his "Al''. The progeny of the Prophet (PBUH) includes his male and female children and their descendants. But after his death none except Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) and her children remained alive.

According to some scholars, `Faith'' means Salat. This is also the sense in which it has been used in the Qur'an: "And Allah would never make your Faith to be lost (i.e., your prayers).'' [2:143]. Thus when Salat is the Faith, the purification is a prerequisite for Salat. Salat is not valid without purification.

It is like the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) that "Hajj is `Arafah'', which means that `Arafat (the place where the pilgrims stay on the 9th day of Dhul- Hijjah) is the most important element of the Hajj. Thus, this Hadith stresses the importance and merits of purification and offers an inducement for it. It also mentions the eminence of the invocations mentioned in the Hadith by saying that if they are given a form, they will fill the space between the heavens and the earth.

Along with this conviction one should do good deeds which please Allah and avoid such deeds which have been prohibited by Him. With this conduct, one should hope for the best from Allah. This approach is similar to that of a cultivator who ploughs his land, sows the seed, waters it, takes every possible care of it and then cherishes hope for a good crop. It can also be linked to the endeavours of a person who intends to become a scholar, or a physician or an engineer. The first and foremost requirement to pursue his ambition is to study the books through which he can gain the required knowledge. For every work one intends to do, one has to first make a foundation and then acquire the means essential for it. It is only then that one can hope to achieve one's aim.(@)(@@) Similar is the case of associating good hopes with Allah. Unless a person does not furnish the foundation of Faith and good deeds for it, it will be unwise to associate good hopes with Allah. A slave who rather than serving his master runs away or annoys him and still hopes that his master being so kind will not take him to task for his excesses would be called stupid by the people. The same is true of Allah, who is certainly the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful and Forgiving. But for whom is He so? The answer is for His faithful and obedient slaves and not for those who are followers of Satan. For Satan and his followers, Allah's Decision is that: "I will fill Hell with you (Iblis) and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together.''

These Divine injunctions are of various kinds, i.e., some of them are obligatory, some desirable and some voluntary. The obligatory ones are compulsory and their compliance is indispensable. What is termed as Mustahabbat (desirables) are also highly important for gaining the Pleasure of Allah. Similarly, voluntary acts are a means of getting close to Allah. Ordinary people are sometimes puzzled by the abundance of the latter and want to adhere to the first two, that is obligations and what comes in the category of desirables. A desire to this effect is mentioned in this Hadith. The Prophet (PBUH) answered the query in this matter by saying to the inquirer, "Keep your tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah.'' Keeping the tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah here means its abundant recitation. In other words, one should make the remembrance of Allah a permanent feature. If one is not able to do many voulntary good works, which some people find difficult, the remembrance of Allah will make up the deficiency in that regard.(@)PageV01P1824(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1439 - وعن جابر رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ من قال : سبحان الله وبحمده غرست له نخلة في الجنة ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن(@)(@@) 1439.

Imam Al-Bukhari is also included among those who hold this view. They say that the words "at all times'' clearly means that. The Prophet (PBUH) used to remember Allah (which includes the recitation of the Qur'an also) no matter whether he was in a state of minor or major pollution. For this reason, Sheikh Al- Albani has objected Imam An-Nawawi's mentioning these two exceptions (pollution resulting from coition and menses) in the relevant title, and has stated that there is no Hadith in support of these exceptions. In fact, the Hadith narrated by `A ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) contradicts this view. In the opinion of this school of thought, the Ahadith which prohibit the remembrance of Allah when a person is in the state of Janabah are weak in authority and are open to discussion. Thus, such Ahadith do not prove the prohibition. In the opinion of the second school of thought, which holds the opposite view, such Ahadith carry weight despite being weak in authority, because their weakness is not serious. Some of them even believe that such Ahadith come to the level of Hadith Hasan. So far logic is concerned, the viewpoint of the first school carries more weight but the reverence of the Qur'an also calls for caution. The best way to create conformity between the two views is that in inevitable situations one may go by the first view but in the ordinary circumstances it is better to follow the second view.

The words such as Subhan-Allah, Al-hamdu lillah, La ilaha illallah, Allahu Akbar etc., are recited and Praise and Glorification of Allah are done after Salat. The groups are quietly engaged in the remembrance of Allah, and those who attend the sermons and speeches delivered in mosques on Friday also come in this category of meetings and gatherings as these are ordained in Islam.

Some people are of the opinion that it is synonymous with poverty combined with abundant children. But Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the view that it is only one of the several kinds of "Troubles of a Trial.'' "Ash-Shaqa' is the opposite of good fortune, that is, to pray for protection from misfortune. No Decision of Allah is wrong but some of His Decisions may be harmful for certain people while others are beneficial for them. This means that their goodness or badness is related to persons. What it signifies is that one should pray to Allah to keep one safe from such decisions which are harmful for him. "Shamatat'' the pleasure that one's enemy feels on one's trouble. In other words, it is prayed that Allah may protect one from any such trouble which is pleasing to one's enemy, because when a person is in trouble, his enemies feel pleasure over it. In this Hadith, one sentence was added by Abu Sufyan and during his old age he did not remember which one it was. But we learn from other Ahadith that it was "the pleasure of enemies''. (Ibn `Allan). This Hadith also shows the honesty and integrity of the narrators of Ahadith. They were honest to the extent that if a few words of supplication were added to a Hadith by its narrators, they would point it out. Some scholars have regarded these words an addition in the Hadith by its narrator, who is otherwise reliable, but it is not a problem of "addition of authority'' because in that case, the addition is the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) which is mentioned by one narrator and omitted by another. But here it is quite different as the narrator of the Hadith himself is pointing out the addition made by him.

The Prophet (PBUH) said, "Whoever has food enough for two people, should take a third one (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or sixth (or said something similar).'' Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took three people with him while Messenger of Allah (PBUH) took ten. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took his supper with the Prophet (PBUH) and stayed there till he offered the `Isha' prayers. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his house. His wife said to him: "What has detained you from your guests?'' He said: "Have you not served supper to them?'' She said: "They refused to take supper until you come.'' [Abdur-Rahman (Abu Bakr's son) or the servants] presented the meal to them but they refused to eat. I (the narrator) hid myself out of fear. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) (my father) rebuked me. Then he said to them: "Please eat. By Allah! I will never eat the meal.'' `Abdur-Rahman added: Whenever we took a morsel of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that morsel we had till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than what was in the beginning. On seeing this, Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) called his wife and said: "O sister of Banu Firas! What is this?'' She said: "O pleasure of my eyes! The food has increased thrice in quantity.'' Then Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) started eating. He said: "My oath not to take the meal was because of Satan.'' He took a morsel handful from it and carried the rest to the Prophet (PBUH). That food remained with him. In those days there was a treaty between us and the pagans and when the period of that treaty elapsed, he (PBUH) divided us into twelve groups and every group was headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each leader. Anyhow, all of them ate of that meal.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) There are some more narrations in both Al-Bukhari and Muslim with very minor differences in wordings and in details.(@)(@@) Commentary: We learn the following points from this Hadith:(@)(@@) 1.
