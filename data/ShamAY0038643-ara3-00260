In the preceding Hadith it has been held 27 times and in the present, 25 times more rewarding. The reason for this variation offered by some `Ulama' is that at first it was told to the Prophet (PBUH) 25 times and then it was increased to 27 and he communicated to his Companions what was revealed to him. Some other scholars have linked it with the form, spirit and concentration of the Salat. The more meticulous one is about its details, the greater will be the reward for it. Another difference of opinion in this respect is regarding the nature of Salat in congregation. How does one become eligible for higher reward? Does he become eligible for it by performing Salat in congregation anywhere, i.e., at home, in business premises, at an open place, in the desert etc., or in that congregation which gathers in a mosque? Some `Ulama' go with the first opinion while others agree with the second. Hafiz Ibn Hajar preferred the second view on the grounds that the words occuring in the text of this Hadith support this view.(@)PageV01P1373(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1066 - وعنه رضي الله عنه قال أتى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم رجل أعمى قال : يا رسول الله ليس لي قائد يقودني إلى المسجد فسأل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرخص له فيصلي في بيته فرخص له فلما ولى دعاه فقال له : [ هل تسمع

There was no gallery nor a separate section for them. Thus, for men the best place for performing Salat in congregation is the first row because it is farthest from women. The best place for women in Salat in congregation is the last row because it is farthest from men. On the contrary, the last row of men was near the first row of women and for this reason it was regarded as the worst one.

One should not lag behind in the acquisition of knowledge and practice and in matters of merit and honour because those who lag behind in such matters are also pushed back by Allah, while those who strive hard to acquire merit and honour are helped by Allah and He makes their way convenient.(@)(@@) This Hadith also stresses the need to stand close to the Imam and has an inducement for excelling each other in virtues.(@)PageV01P1397(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1086 - وعن أبي مسعود رضي الله عنه قال كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يمسح مناكبنا في الصلاة ويقول : [ استووا ولا تختلفوا فتختلف قلوبكم ليلني منكم أولو الأحلام والنهى ثم الذين يلونهم ثم الذين يلونهم ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 1086. Abu Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to gently pat our shoulders when we were standing in rows at the time of Salat and say, "Keep (the rows) straight; do not differ from each other lest your hearts should suffer from discord. Let those of you who are mature and prudent be nearer to me, and then those who are next to them.''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: "To gently pat our shoulders'' means that he would set their shoulders right to straighten the row. "Do not differ from each other'' here means that they should stand shoulder to shoulder and ankle to ankle in a straight line. The reason is that disorder will have a spiritual effect and will create discord. The latter would eventually result in the domination of enmity. Thus, we learn from this Hadith that the Imam should stress on his followers the importance of setting their rows straight; and if his exhortation fails, he should go to them personally and set their lines in order. We also learn from this Hadith that men known for wisdom, knowledge and piety should stand in the first row and these should be followed by those who come next to them in these virtues.(@)PageV01P1398(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1087 - وعن أنس رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : [ سووا صفوفكم(@)(@@) فإن تسوية الصف من تمام الصلاة ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) وفي رواية للبخاري : [ فإن تسوية الصفوف من إقامة الصلاة ](@)(@@) 1087.

But it does not mean that he was always capable of doing so, as is being impressed by certain people. The true position is that it was a miracle which happened with the Will of Allah at the time when the Prophet (PBUH) was leading the Salat in congregation. It must be borne in mind that a miracle happens with the Will of Allah only. It is not at all in the power of the Prophet (PBUH). Had he been capable of working a miracle on his own, he would have shown it at his own pleasure. But no Prophet was ever capable of it, nor was the Prophet (PBUH) an exception to this rule.(@)(@@) The second point that we learn from this Hadith is that of setting the rows straight, which, in practical terms, means that those who stand up for offering Salat in congregation must stand so close to each other that their shoulders and feet are in touch. The Prophet (PBUH) used the word "Tarassu" to describe this position which means that they should stand like a brick wall, each unit of which is riveted with the other. This is the meaning which the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) understood from it and this is what they actually practised. Many people nowadays do not stand in Salat shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot. Some people dislike this practice.

"Put your faces in opposite directions'' signifies that "Allah will create enmity in you'', which will create dissension rather than unity, weakness rather than strength and power, and the Muslims will then be overwhelmed with the fear and terror of their enemies. This phrase can also have a literal meaning, that is in consequence of confusion in your ranks, Allah will turn your face towards the napes of your necks and distort them.

To join rows means that no space should be left between the two persons who stand in a line. Similarly, a second row should not be started without completing the first one. To break a row means to leave space in it or start the second row without completing the first."Break him and Join him" can be the words of prayer as well as imprecation, for what they mean is "May Allah join him or break him.'' This is a prayer from the Prophet (PBUH) for the person who straightens the rows as well as an imprecation for the one who breaks the rows.(@)PageV01P1403(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1092 - وعن أنس رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ رصوا صفوفكم وقاربوا

This means that there should not be much space between the two rows. The maximum space allowed for it is three spans. Space in excess of this is disapproved and takes away the merit of offering Salat in congregation. This formula does not apply to the rows of women because a larger distance between the rows of men and women is more meritorious. (Ibn `Allan).(@)(@@) "Put your necks in line'' here means to stand shoulder to shoulder - a point which has already been stressed. Viewing Satan secretly entering into the space left in the rows can be correct literally as well as technically. In the former case, it is a miracle of the Prophet (PBUH) while in the latter it is Wahy (Revelation). Almighty Allah informed him that Satan enters the rows of the people offering prayers through the spaces left by them in their rows. Satan is pleased to see these gaps as they make his task of creating doubts in the minds of worshippers easy.(@)PageV01P1404(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1093 - وعنه رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ أتموا الصف المقدم ثم الذي يليه فما كان من نقص فليكن في الصف المؤخر ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد حسن(@)(@@) 1093.

They are called Sunnah Mu'akkadah or As- Sunnan Ar-Rawatib That is, the Rak`ah which are proved from the saying and practice of the Prophet (PBUH) and which were performed by him usually. These are said to be Compulsory prayers. Secondly, such Nawafil which were not performed by the Prophet (PBUH) regularly. These are called Sunnah Ghair Mu'akkadah and are said to be Optional prayers. In any case, Nawafil have great importance in creating a special link between the worshipper and Allah, and for this reason the believers do not neglect them. But their status in Shari`ah is of Nawafil the performing of which is rewarding and omission of which is not sinful. One thing that should be borne in mind in respect of As-Sunnan Ar- Rawatib or Mu'akkadah is that it is better to perform them at home.

It also mentions his offering of Tahajjud prayer, which consists of eleven Rak`ah. He would perform this Salat in the form of four couplets and one Witr. According to some narrations, he would perform four couplets and supplement them with three Rak`ah of Witr. Both these forms are right. This Hadith, also proves the validity of one Witr.(@)(@@) This Hadith also tells us that the time for the Tahajjud and Witr prayer is from `Isha' prayer to the daybreak. One can perform Tahajjud prayer at any time during this period. But, the best time for it is the third part of the night for the reason that after Tahajjud one can, after a while, perform Fajr prayer in congregation (Jama`ah).(@)(@@) The Tarawih (optional night prayer) performed in the month of Ramadan is this Tahajjud prayer which is also termed as Qiyam-ul-Lail For the sake of convenience and benefit of congregational prayer, it is offered soon after `Isha' prayer in the month of Ramadan. The right number of Rak`ah in the Tarawih prayer is eight because the Prophet (PBUH) never offered more than eight Rak`ah; with three Witr in the month of Ramadan or otherwise. `Aishah's statement to this effect quoted in Sahih Al- Bukhari also supports this fact. In Hadith literature, the Nawafil of the night have been termed as Qiyam-ul-Lail for which the word "Tahajjud'' has also been used in the Qur'an and Hadith. The word "Tarawih'' does not figure anywhere in Hadith. The word "Tarawih'' for "Qiyam-ul-Lail'' became popular after the era of the Prophet (PBUH) and his Companions. Thus, that number of Tarawih prayer agrees with the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) which is proved by the actual practice of the Prophet (PBUH), that is eight Rak`ah and three Witr only. It is not in any case twenty Rak`ah.

Therefore, one must praise and glorify Allah. Since a single invocation of the words mentioned in this Hadith is equivalent to one Sadaqah, one must say these words for 360 times - a number which equals the number of joints in man's body. Moreover, to enjoin someone to do what is good and dissuade somebody from vice constitutes Sadaqah. However, if one performs two Rak`ah of Duha prayer, it will serve for Sadaqah for all the joints of the body. Thus, this Hadith highlights the merits and importance of Duha prayer. We also learn from this Hadith that Sadaqah is not restricted to spending money alone but also has a vast meaning and covers all forms of virtues mentioned here.(@)PageV01P1466(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1141 - وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يصلي الضحى أربعا ويزيد ما شاء الله . رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 1141. `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to perform four Rak`ah of Duha prayer (at the forenoon) and would add to them whatever Allah wished.(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: We learn from this Hadith that the Prophet (PBUH) used to perform usually four Rak`ah in Duha prayers but sometimes he also performed more.

There is a difference of opinion on these issues. Some people think that Duha and Ishraq are two different names for one and the same prayer, and this is performed soon after sunrise. While others think that the earliest time of Duha prayer is soon after sunrise and the last is a little before the sun begins to decline. The one performed in the early hours is called Ishraq prayer, while the one performed in the late hours is called Duha prayer. Some people say that the two Rak`ah performed at the time when the sun is at a height of a lance in the sky is Ishraq, and the one, comprising four Rak`ah, performed when the sun covers one fourth of the sky is Duha.

Ishraq prayer must be performed when the sun rises about a lance in the sky while the time for Duha prayer occurs when the hoofs of the animals begin to burn and they feel troubled with the heat of the sun. Usually the six Rak`ah performed after Maghrib prayer are called Salat-ul-Awwabin (prayer of the penitent) which is founded on a weak Hadith. In the present authentic Hadith, Duha prayer is interpreted as Salat-ul-Awwabin.
