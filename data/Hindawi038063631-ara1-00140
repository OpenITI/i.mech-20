ms121	 يهدد فيه الأمن العالمي من قبل انهيار الأنظمة الحاكمة، والإرهاب النووي، والدول الحائزة حديثا على الأسلحة النووية، والصراعات الإقليمية، والترسانات النووية الموجودة من قبل. والمخاطر التي ينطوي عليها هذا المزيج تتعاظم كثيرا بفعل سهولة الحصول على التكنولوجيا النووية، والحماية غير الكافية لمخزون البلوتونيوم واليورانيوم عالي التخصيب، والتوافر المتزايد للصواريخ حول العالم (إذ تملك 31 دولة صواريخ بالستية)، وشبكات السوق السوداء التي تتعامل في المواد النووية، والتوجه نحو امتلاك قدرات «كامنة» لتصنيع الأسلحة النووية من خلال امتلاك الدورة الكاملة للوقود النووي. ونتائج ذلك واضحة؛ فمن بين جميع الأخطار الممكنة التي قد تتهدد المجتمع الدولي اليوم (بما في ذلك الاحترار العالمي)، فإن الأسلحة النووية - أشد الأسلحة التي تم ابتكارها فتكا، والسلاح الوحيد في الواقع ذا الدمار الشامل - تمثل على الأرجح الخطر الأعظم. حقا؛ لا تزال الأسلحة النووية أمرا شديد الأهمية.(@)(@)(@)(@)(@)(@)(@@) | المراجع والقراءات الإضافية(@)(@)(@)(@)(@)(@@) In addition to the giants on whose shoulders I have stood for more than 30 years and who are recognized in the text and bibliography that follows, I should like to thank the many archivists and librarians in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom who are all too often taken for granted. I should also like to thank my former students Jason Flanagan and Jacqui Bird for their thoughtful analyses of the career of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the role of atomic scientists in the making of nuclear weapons, respectively. Needless to say, there is a vast literature on various aspects of the politics of nuclear weaponry and the problems and prospects of dealing with nuclear weapons. The publications listed below represent the tip of that iceberg and include the most important studies in English. Constraints of space have made it necessary to omit many excellent and important works in the field.(@)(@)(@@) الفصل الأول(@)(@)(@@) The best place to begin the study of nuclear weapons is the pages of the(@)(@)(@@) Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , founded in 1945 as a newsletter distributed among nuclear physicists concerned by the possibility of nuclear war; for 60 years the(@)(@)(@@) Bulletin’s(@)(@)(@@) Doomsday Clock has followed the rise and fall of nuclear tensions.
