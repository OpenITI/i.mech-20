Then he stood up and raised his hands for a while, after which he prostrated himself for the third time. Then he (PBUH) said, "I supplicated my Rubb and made intercession for my Ummah, and He granted me one-third of them. So I again prostrated myself in gratitude to my Rubb. Then I raised my head and supplicated my Rubb for my Ummah, and He granted me another third of them. Again I raised my head and supplicated my Rubb for my Ummah and He granted me the last third of them. So I fell into prostration out of gratitude before my Rubb.''(@)(@@) [Abu Dawud].(@)(@@) Commentary: The phrase "I supplicated my Rubb and made intercession for my Ummah'' means that the Prophet (PBUH) prayed to Allah to pardon his Ummah and to admit them to Jannah. The interpretation of this Hadith is stated to be that ultimately all the Muslims will be sent to Jannah. They will not abide in Hell for ever. Some of them will go to Jannah after suffering the punishment for their major sins, some through the intercession of the Prophet (PBUH), and some by the Special Grace of Allah. This interpretation is no doubt true. This is confirmed by other Ahadith and forms the belief of the followers of Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). But the Hadith under discussion is not "Sahih''. However, Sujud- ush-Shukr (prostrations for thanksgiving), in support of which Imam An- Nawawi has reproduced this Hadith here, is also proved by other Ahadith. To prostrate in gratitude to Allah is correct and permissible . The incident of K`ab bin Malik is included in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, which shows that after he came to know that his repentance was accepted, he prostrated to give thanks to Allah. According to the Shafi`i school of thought, the basic elements of Sujud-ush-Shukr (or prostrations to express thanks to Allah) are: (a) the intention (in the heart), (b) the Takbir, (c) prostration and (d) Taslim; the Hanafi school of thought, however, maintain that it is an act of prostration between two Takbir. It is permissible to perform it outside Salat, but not during it because it will invalidate it, if one does so deliberately.(@)PageV01P1491(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 212 - باب فضل قيام الليل(@)(@@) Chapter 212(@)(@@) Excellence of Standing in Prayer at Night PageV01P1492 قال الله تعالى ( الإسراء 79 ) : { ومن الليل فتهجد به نافلة لك عسى أن يبعثك ربك مقاما محمودا }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( السجدة 16 ) : { تتجافى جنوبهم عن المضاجع } الآية(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الذاريات 17 ) : { كانوا قليلا من الليل ما يهجعون }(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "And in some parts of the night (also) perform the Salat (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur'an in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer - Nawafil) for you (O Muhammad (PBUH)).

It also urges one to perpetuate his good actions, follow the practice of the righteous and avoid the way of those who are negligent or become negligent in the performance of virtuous deeds. Urination of Satan in a person's ear or ears can be literally true (although we cannot perceive it) because if a person does not seek the protection of Allah against Satan, then Satan joins him in food and other activities, as is evident from other Ahadith. Therefore, urination of Satan is also possible. Some people think it is a metaphor to the effect that he who does not get up at night for prayer and goes on enjoying his sleep, Satan `closes' his ears until he does not hear the remembrance of Allah. Some others consider it a metaphor for the contempt and insult of Satan. In either case, we learn from this Hadith that missing the Qiyam-ul-Lail is disliked because it provides Satan an opportunity to create mischief, and he succeeds in creating obstructions in the worship and obedience of Allah.(@)PageV01P1498(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1165 - وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ يعقد الشيطان على قافية رأس أحدكم إذا هو نام ثلاث عقد يضرب على كل عقدة : عليك ليل طويل فارقد فإن استيقظ فذكر الله تعالى انحلت عقدة فإن توضأ انحلت عقدة فإن صلى انحلت عقده فأصبح نشيطا طيب النفس وإلا أصبح خبيث النفس كسلان ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) [ قافية الرأس ] : آخره(@)(@@) 1165.

He (PBUH) then started reciting Surat An-Nisa' which he followed with Surat Al-Imran. He recited leisurely. When he recited an Ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say Subhan Allah and when he recited the Ayah which tells how the Rubb is to be asked, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would then ask from Him; and when he (PBUH) recited an Ayah asking one to seek Protection Allah, he would seek Protection of Allah. Then he bowed and said, "Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim (My Rubb the Great is free from imperfection)''; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing, (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku`) he would say, "Sami' Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana lakal-hamd (Allah listens to him who praises Him. Praise be to You, Our Rubb!),'' and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing.

Qiyam in the month of Ramadan is a much-stressed act and has great importance from the viewpoint of reward and award.(@)(@@) 2. The sins which are pardoned through it are minor sins because major sins are not forgiven unless one makes sincere repentance and compensates those whom he has wronged.(@)(@@) 3. That Qiyam during the month of Ramadan was the practice of the Prophet (PBUH). During the course of a Ramadan, he made Qiyam for three nights consecutively, that is, he performed this Nafl Salat in congregation with his Companions. On the fourth night, when his Companions gathered for this purpose he said to them, "I am afraid it will be made obligatory for you.'' So, in spite of their desire to join him in this prayer, he did not lead the Salat that night. How many Rak`ah did he perform in congregation in these three nights is a pertinent question here. According to Ahadith their total comes to eleven; eight Rak`ah and three Witr. Thus the Masnun number of Rak`ah of Qiyam Ramadan is eleven.(@)(@@) 4. This Nafl Salat has been interpreted in Ahadith as Qiyam Ramadan. Later on they were named Tarawih. Tarawih is the plural of Tarwihah. Since the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) and the successors to the Companions used to make a lengthy Qiyam in them and they would take rest after performing every four Rak`ah. This is how these came to be named Tarawih (Rest prayer). (Four Rak`ah are called Tarwihah).(@)(@@) 5. Tarawih are in fact Tahajjud prayers. For the sake of convenience and benefit of the maximum number of people, it is performed in the month of Ramadan soon after `Isha' prayer, along with the latter, which is the early time for Tahajjud prayers.(@)(@@) 6. That the Tarawih were performed in congregation is established from the conduct of the Prophet (PBUH). He led this Salat on 23rd, 25th and 27th of Ramadan. During his caliphate, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) started it again and ordered Ubayy bin K`ab and Tamim Ad-Dari to perform them in congregation. He enjoined them to perform eight Rak`ah Tarawih and three Rak`ah Witr. This practice has been going on ever since.(@)(@@) 7. Some people say that performing Tarawih in congregation is a Bid`ah (innovation in religion) because it was introduced in the reign of `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him). But this is not correct because it is established that the Prophet (PBUH) did not continue it out of fear that it will be made obligatory; otherwise he would have carried on with it. When the fear that this practice be made obligatory was over, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) gave it the form of a Nafl prayer and revived the mode of performing it collectively, and thus fulfilled the desire of the Prophet (PBUH). In spite of all these facts, it is still permissible for one to perform Tarawih individually in the late hours of the night. Since ordinary people are not capable of performing it individually, the step taken by `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) is perfectly correct. If this had not been done, the majority of the people will have remained deprived of the blessings and reward of Qiyam-ul-Lail, which would have been a great deprivation indeed.(@)(@@) 8. Twenty Rak`ah Tarawih is not confirmed from any authentic Hadith, nor its ascription to `Umar i(May Allah be pleased with him)is proved from any reliable Muttasil (connected) Hadith. A claim has been made in a Munqati` (disconnected) narration that in the days of `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) people used to perform twenty, thirty-six and forty Rak`ah of Tarawih out of which one can at best infer the justification for more than eight Rak`ah Nafl prayer. Even then the Masnun Tarawih will be eight Rak`ah only, and more or less than that will be Ghair- Masnun.(@)(@@) 9. In Tarawih, that is Qiyam Ramadan, lengthy Qiyam is Masnun, but it must be borne in mind that the Qur'an must be recited according to the principles of `Ilm-ut-Tajwid with clear and distinct voice at a slow pace. Many of the Qurra recite so fast that it is hard for one to understand, let alone concentrate on what is being recited. Such recitation is a means of retribution rather than reward. A new system is now in vogue: According to this fashion, the whole Qur'an is finished within a few days and eight to ten parts of it are recited daily in Tarawih. There are hundreds of thousands people in the audience. After listening the Qur'an for a few days, these people console themselves that they have heard the entire Qur'an in Tarawih and are now free to pay full attention to their business to make the best of the `Eid season. They do not care to know whether the Qari is reciting the Qur'an or something else.(@)PageV01P1523(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 214 - باب فضل قيام ليلة القدر وبيان أرجى لياليها(@)(@@) Chapter 214(@)(@@) The Superiority of Lailat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) PageV01P1524 قال الله تعالى ( سورة القدر ) : { إنا أنزلناه في ليلة القدر } إلى آخر السورة(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الدخان 3 ) : { إنا أنزلناه في ليلة مباركة } الآيات(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "Verily, We have sent it (this Qur'an) down in the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree).

The night is neither very hot nor very cold but a temperate one. Similarly, the sun that rises on the next day is also not very hot etc. etc. Allah knows the truth of the matter despite all that has been said in this regard.

Some `Ulama' are of the opinion that the tenth quality among them is circumcision. Anyway, the importance of these ten qualities and the stress on them are evident. The first thing among them is the trimming of moustache. This is Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH) and is meant to cut the projected hair on the upper lip.(@)(@@) 2. In the opinion of `Ulama', keeping the beard is compulsory but its extent is not determined. On the basis of Ibn `Umar's practice, some `Ulama' hold that the size of handful is essential and beyond that cutting is permissible, or according to a weak narration some consider its trimming towards length and breadth quite fair. But this opinion is not correct. In the words of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, the Prophet (PBUH) used five words for it which are (a'fu, aufu, arkhu, arju, waq'iru) and all of them have similar meanings that the beard should be left alone on natural growth. But, for a few exceptional cases, the common injunction in this behalf is that one should keep full beard. One should neither trim it in length and breadth nor make it handful in size. One can, however, bring it to a normal size in case of its wild growth if one fears that it will cause derision and laughter.(@)(@@) 3,4.

The removal of the underarm hair and below the naval is an integral part of cleanliness and inordinate delay in it is disliked.

Allegiance to them is, in other words, allegiance to Islam. It is a pledge which was taken by the Prophet (PBUH) from everyone who embraced Islam. He would also take a pledge for Jihad when there was a need for it. The third pledge is pledge of Khalifah which was taken by Khulafa Ar-Rashidun (the rightly- guided caliphs) and subsequently the Muslim rulers. These are the three pledges which are proved from the rightly-guided Muslims.

Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due on it (i.e., the Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead and back will be branded. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell.'' It was asked, "How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?'' He (PBUH) replied, "In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.'' It was (again) asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?'' He (PBUH) said, "If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.'' It was asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?'' Upon this he (PBUH) said, "The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. When their owner leads them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend to quench their thirst, yet Allah would record for him the quantity (of water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds.'' It was asked: "O Messenger of Allah, what about the donkeys?'' Upon this he (PBUH) said, "Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys in particular except this one Verse of a comprehensive nature: "So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.'''

This wording makes the text more orderly and evident and this is how it occurs in some of the narrations.

In the first instance these words are used for noble intention. That is to fulfill humanly needs with it so that one does not have to beg them from others. In the second instance these words stand for Jihad. That is one breeds horses to make use of them in Jihad.

Fasting is a shield. When anyone of you is observing fast, he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice; and if anyone reviles him or tries to quarrel with him, he should say: `I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hand the soul of Muhammad is, the breath of one observing Saum is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk.

The person observing Saum abstains from food and drink only for My sake.' The fasting person has two joyous occasions, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time of meeting his Rubb.

It results from the thirst and hunger which he has to suffer during the Saum. The Hadith not only tells us the merits of Saum but also brings into focus the true significance of it.

In that case, the injunction is that thirty days of the month be completed. If the moon of Ramadan is not sighted on the 29th Sha`ban, then its thirty days be completed and Ramadan's Saum be started on the next day. Similarly, if the moon for the month of Shawwal is not sighted on the 29th of Ramadan, thirty days of Saum must be completed before celebrating `Eid-ul-Fitr. This means that the sighting of the moon is necessary for keeping the Saum of Ramadan. Counting by celestial system is not sufficient for this purpose. Moreover, the evidence of reliable witnesses for the crescent of Ramadan and the evidence of two dependable witnesses for the crescent of Shawwal are sufficient. This amount of evidence will fulfill the requirement of sighting the moon. Whether the sighting of the moon at one place is sufficient for another place is controversial and arguments of both the groups of `Ulama', who support and oppose it, are based on this Hadith. The group which contend that the sighting of the moon at one place is valid for another holds that the words "Sumu" and "Aftiru" are addressed to all the Muslims, and for this reason the sighting at one place holds good for another place. The group which holds that the sighting of the moon at one place is not enough for the Muslims of other localities contend that the words are addressed to the people who have actually sighted the moon. The Muslims of the localities of other areas who have not sighted the moon are not addressed by these words. They say that the sighting of the moon goes with each area according to which they will decide about starting of Saum and celebrating `Eid. There is a third group also, which is of the opinion that for such areas which are in close proximity and do not have much difference in the timings of sunrise and sunset, the sighting of the moon at one place holds good for the other. In any case, it is a moderate view, which can be implemented without fear of its being wrong. According to this view, at least in one country the sighting of the moon at one place holds good for all other areas.(@)PageV01P1563(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 218 - باب الجود وفعل المعروف والإكثار من الخير في شهر رمضان والزيادة من ذلك في العشر الأواخر منه(@)(@@) Chapter 218(@)(@@) The Excellence of Spending out Charity during Ramadan(@)PageV01P1564(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1222 - عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنه قال : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أجود الناس وكان أجود ما يكون في رمضان حين يلقاه جبريل وكان يلقاه جبريل في كل ليلة من رمضان فيدارسه القرآن فلرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حين يلقاه جبريل أجود بالخير من الريح المرسلة ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1222.

In spite of this distinction of Sha`ban, Muslims have been ordered to observe Saum in the first fortnight only, and not in the second in order to maintain their energy and vitality for the obligatory Saum (i.e., Ramadan). The Prophet (PBUH) had greater spiritual strength and Saum did not cause him weakness due to this strength.

On this day, pilgrims stop and stand in prayers at `Arafat which is the most important ritual of Hajj, so much so that Hajj is deemed incomplete without it. On that day, the pilgrims are engaged in the remembrance of Allah and prayers as that is their most important worship on that day. For this reason, Saum is not desirable for them, but for other people, Saum has a special merit. The importance and merit of this Saum can be judged from the fact that it expiates sins for two consecutive years: the previous year and the current year.

In another Hadith, it is stated that when the Prophet (PBUH) emigrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah, he saw that the Jews were fasting on this day. He asked them why they did this on that day, and they told him that they did it for the reason that Allah granted Prophet Musa emancipation from Pharaoh on this day, and so they observed Saum in token of their joy. On this, he (PBUH) said that in this happiness of Prophet Musa, Muslims have a greater right to observe Saum than the Jews. Consequently, he also observed Saum on 10th of Muharram. Then, he said that if he lived the following year, he would observe Saum on 9th of Muharram also so that they would make themselves different from the Jews. According to another Hadith, he (PBUH) ordained the Muslims to observe Saum on `Ashura' and in addition one more Saum on 9th or 11th of Muharram in opposition to the Jews. (Musnad Ahmad, Vol.4, P-21, edited by Ahmad Shakir; and Mujamma` Az-Zawaid, Vol.3, P-188). Thus observance of two Saum on this occasion is a Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). These two Saum can be observed either on 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of Muharram.

One can observe these six-day Saum at a stretch or with intervals, but their observance one after the other at the beginning of the month is better.

This was during the time the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) performed the Hajjat- ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage).(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith points out the fact that it is permissible to take children to Hajj. The reward of their Hajj will be given to their parents. But when after attaining maturity the child becomes liable for Hajj, it will be necessary for him to perform it again because the one he has performed in childhood, will not be sufficient for him. The reason behind taking children to Hajj is to teach them how to perform this obligation.(@)PageV01P1643(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1282 - وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم لقي ركبا بالروحاء فقال : [ من القوم ؟ ] قالوا : المسلمون . قالوا : من أنت ؟ قال : [ رسول الله ] فرفعت امرأة صبيا فقالت : ألهذا حج ؟ قال : [ نعم ولك أجر ] رواه مسلم(@)(@@) 1282. Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (PBUH) came across a caravan at Ar-Rauha' and asked who the people in the caravan were. They replied that they were Muslims. They asked: "Who are you?'' He (PBUH) said, "I am the Messenger of Allah.'' Then a woman lifted up a boy to him and asked: "Would this child be credited with having performed the Hajj (pilgrimage)?''

Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) performed the pilgrimage on an unsaddled camel which also carried his provisions (i.e., his Zamilah).(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: "Zamilah'' is a mount like a horse, mule etc., on which luggage is loaded while travelling. What it means here is that the Prophet (PBUH) travelled for Hajj on such a mount on which he kept his provision for the journey also. In other words, it was his Zamilah as well. This incident happened during Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage). This Hadith shows the Prophet's total humility and humbleness and his disregard for the life of the world.(@)PageV01P1645(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1284 - وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال : كانت عكاظ ومجنة وذو المجاز أسواقا في الجاهلية فتأثموا أن يتجروا في المواسم فنزلت ( البقرة 198 ) : { ليس عليكم جناح أن تبتغوا فضلا من ربكم } في مواسم الحج . رواه البخاري(@)(@@) 1284. Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ukaz, Mijannah and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the pre-Islamic period. The Companions disliked trading there till the following Ayat of the Noble Qur'an were revealed: "There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Rubb (during pilgrimage by trading)...'' (2:198)(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: The Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) considered trade and commerce during the months of Hajj as sinful because they thought that trade had a sort of resemblance with the bazaars which were arranged on the occasion of Hajj in the pre-Islamic period. Through the Ayah quoted in this Hadith, Almighty Allah removed their misunderstanding. Therefore, trade and commerce on this occasion do not violate the Hajj and `Umrah. This is however, only a permission. If one wants to earn reward in the Hereafter through his utmost devotion to Allah, it is more meritorious to avoid commercial activities and wholeheartedly concentrate on the remembrance of Allah and His worship.(@)PageV01P1646(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) | AUTO 11- كتاب الجهاد(@)(@@) Book Eleven: The Book of Jihad(@)PageV01P1647(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 234 - باب PageV01P1648 قال الله تعالى ( التوبة 36 ) : { وقاتلوا المشركين كافة كما يقاتلونكم كافة واعلموا أن الله مع المتقين }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( البقرة 216 ) : { كتب عليكم القتال وهو كره لكم وعسى أن تكرهوا شيئا وهو خير لكم وعسى أن تحبوا شيئا وهو شر لكم والله يعلم وأنتم لا تعلمون }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( التوبة 41 ) : { انفروا خفافا وثقالا وجاهدوا بأموالكم وأنفسكم في سبيل الله }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( التوبة 111 ) : { إن الله اشترى من المؤمنين أنفسهم وأموالهم بأن لهم الجنة يقاتلون في سبيل الله فيقتلون ويقتلون وعدا عليه حقا في التوراة والإنجيل والقرآن ومن أوفى بعهده من الله فاستبشروا ببيعكم الذي بايعتم
